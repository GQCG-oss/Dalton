\chapter{Molecular response functions, RESPONSE}
\label{ch:response}

\section{General}

\resp\ is the part of the code for calculating molecular
response properties.

\section{\Sec{*RESPONSE} directives}\label{sec:rspinp}

The following directives may be included in the input to \resp.
They are organized according to the program section names in which they
appear.

In addition, SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator}
(Second-Order Polarization Propagator 
approximation) for the calculation of linear response\index{linear response}
properties are requested in this input section. The current
implementation of the SOPPA method is described 
in Ref.~\cite{mjpekdtehjajjojcp}. Note that a SOPPA calculation
requires the keyword \Key{SOPPA}.

\subsection{End of input: \Sec{END OF}}

The last directive of the \Sec{*RESPONSE} input may be \Sec{END OF}

\subsection{General: \Sec{*RESPONSE}}

General-purpose directives are given in the \Sec{*RESPONSE} section.

\begin{description}

\item{\Key{NOAVDI}}
Do not use Fock type decoupling of the two-electron density matrix.
Add $F^ID$ instead of $(F^I+F^A)D$ to $E^{[2]}$ approximate
orbital diagonal. 

\item{\Key{INPTES}}
Input test. For debugging purposes only. The program stops after the
input section.

\item{\Key{HIRPA}}
Invoke the higher RPA approximation for the calculation of linear
response properties. This approximation is identical to that of McKoy
and coworkers~\cite{jrtsvmjcp58,tsjrvmjcp58}. The requirements to the
preceding wave function 
calculation is the same as for the \Key{SOPPA} keyword.

\item{\Key{MAXPHP}}\\
\verb|READ *, MAXPHP|\\
Change the maximum dimension of $H_0$ subspace.   Default is 100.
PHP is a subblock of the CI matrix which is calculated explicitly
in order to obtain improved CI trial vectors compared to the
straight Davidson algorithm\cite{erdjcp17}.  The configurations
corresponding to 
the lowest diagonal elements are selected, unless .PHPRESIDUAL is
specified. MAXPHP is the maximum dimension of PHP, the 
actual dimension will be less if MAXPHP will split degenerate configurations.
 
\item{\Key{MAXRM}}\\
\verb|READ *, MAXRM |\\
Change the maximum dimension of the reduced space. Default is 200.
When solving a linear system of equations or an eigenvalue equation,
the reduced space is increased by 1 in each iteration. For single root
calculations this should exceed the number of iterations required.

\item{\Key{NODOIT}}
Turns off direct one-index transformation \cite{ovhahjajjcc15}. 
In this way all one-index
transformed integrals are stored on disk.

\item{\Key{NOITRA}}
No integral transformation. Normally the two-electron integrals are 
transformed in the beginning of a response calculation. In some cases
this is not desirable, e.g., if the response part is only used for
calculating average values of operator, or if the transformed two-electron
integrals already exist from a previous response calculation. 

\item{\Key{S0MIX}}
Sum rule is calculated in mixed representation, that is, calculate
$N_e=\langle0\mid [r,p] \mid0\rangle$ provided that dipole length and
velocity integrals are available on the property integral file 
(calculated with \Sec{*HERMIT} options \Key{DIPLEN} and \Key{DIPVEL}).
The calculated quantity gives a measure of the quality of the basis
set\index{basis set quality}.

\item{\Key{OPTORB}}
Orbital trial vectors are calculated with optimal orbital
trial\index{optimal orbital trial vector} vector
algorithm \cite{tuhjahjajpjjcp84}.

\item{\Key{ORBSFT}}\\
\verb|READ *, ORBSFT|\\
Change the amount for shifting the orbital diagonal\index{orbital
diagonal Hessian} of the MCSCF Hessian.
May be used if there is a large number of negative eigenvalues.
Default is $10^{-4}$. 

\item{\Key{ORBSPC}}
Calculation with only orbital operators. 

\item{\Key{PHPRES}}
Select configurations for PHP matrix based on largest residual
rather than lowest diagonal elements.

\item{\Key{PROPAV}} \\
\verb|READ '(A)', LABEL|\\
Property average\index{property average}. The average value of an
operator is calculated. 
The line following this option must contain the
label of the operator given in the integral property file.
(See section \ref{ch:hermit}.)

\item{\Key{QRREST}}
Restart quadratic response\index{quadratic response} calculation.

\item{\Key{RSPCI}}
Configuration interaction\index{configuration interaction}\index{CI}
response calculation. 

\item{\Key{SOPPA}}
Required, no defaults. \\
The SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator} flag requires that
the preceding SIRIUS calculation has generated the MP2 correlation
coefficients and written them to disk. (Set \Key{RUN RESPONSE} in \Sec{*DALTON}
input as well as \Key{HF} and \Key{MP2} in \Sec{*WAVE FUNCTION}). See
example input in Chapter~\ref{ch:starting}.

\item{\Key{SOPW4}}
Calculate explicitly the W4 term described by Odderhede {\it et
al.\/}~\cite{jopjdlycpr2}. This term is already included in the normal
SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator} result, and used mostly for comparing to older
calculations. Note that this keyword requires that \Key{SOPPA} is set.

\item{\Key{TRPFLG}}
Triplet flag. This option is set whenever triplet
(spin-dependent)\index{triplet response}
operators must be used in a response calculation
\cite{jodlypjjcp91,ovhapjhjajthjojcp97}
