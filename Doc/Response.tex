\label{ch:response}

\section{Directives for evaluation of molecular response functions}\label{sec:rspinp}

The directives in the following subsections may be included in the input to \resp.
They are organized according to the program section names in which they
appear.

\resp\ is the most general part of the code for calculating
many different electronic linear, quadratic, or cubic molecular
response properties based on SCF, MCSCF or CI wave functions, as well as Kohn--Sham-based time-dependent density functional theory.
No nuclear contributions are added.

If the final wave function from \Sec{*WAVE FUNCTIONS} was \Key{CI}, then
a configuration interaction\index{Configuration Interaction!response}\index{CI!response}
response calculation will be performed.
This is equivalent to a CI sum-over-states\index{response!CI sum-over-states}
calculation of response properties,
but of course calculated directly without diagonalization of the full
CI Hamiltonian matrix.

Some of the SCF/MCSCF response properties can also be requested
from \Sec{*PROPERTIES} input modules.
NOTE: for such properties you should request them either here or
in \Sec{*PROPERTIES}, otherwise you will calculate them twice!
Usually the output is nicest in
the \Sec{*PROPERTIES} module ({\it e.g.\/} collected in tables and in
commonly used units, most properties are only given in atomic
units in \resp), and nuclear contributions are included if relevant.
Some specific properties, especially those involving nuclear derivatives,
can only be calculated via \Sec{*PROPERTIES}.

Calculations of coupled cluster response properties are performed
by different modules and are described
in Chapter~\ref{ch:CC} on coupled cluster calculations.

In addition, SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator}
(Second-Order Polarization Propagator approximation),
SOPPA(CC2)\index{SOPPA(CC2)} or SOPPA(CCSD)\index{SOPPA(CCSD)} (Second
Order Polarization Propagator Approximation with Coupled Cluster
Singles and Doubles Amplitudes) for the calculation of linear response
\index{linear response}\index{response!linear}
properties and excitation energies with transition moments may be
requested in this input section. The current implementation of the
SOPPA method is described in Ref.~\cite{mjpekdtehjajjojcp}, of the
SOPPA(CC2) method in Ref.~\cite{spas097} and of the SOPPA(CCSD) method
in Ref.~\cite{soppaccsd}. Note that a SOPPA calculation requires the
keyword \Key{SOPPA}, whereas a SOPPA(CC2) or SOPPA(CCSD) calculation
requires the keyword \Key{SOPPA(CCSD)}.

\subsection{General: \Sec{*RESPONSE}}

General-purpose directives are given in the \Sec{*RESPONSE} section.

After the last directive of the \Sec{*RESPONSE} input group
should follow another {\ttfamily{**<something>}} input group
(or \Sec{*END OF DALTON INPUT} if this was the last input to \dalton).

\begin{description}
%\item{\Key{DFT-SO}} Request that the contribution to the spin--orbit
  %integrals are calculated for a given reference density.

\item{\Key{HIRPA}}
Invoke the higher RPA approximation for the calculation of linear
response properties\index{linear response!higher RPA}.
This approximation is identical to that of McKoy
and coworkers~\cite{jrtsvmjcp58,tsjrvmjcp58}. The requirements to the
preceding wave function
calculation is the same as for the \Key{SOPPA} keyword.
This keyword overrides a simultaneous specification of \Key{SOPPA}.

\item{\Key{INPTEST}}
Input test. For debugging purposes only. The program stops after the
input section.

\item{\Key{MAXPHP}}\\
\verb|READ *, MAXPHP|\\
Change the maximum dimension of $H_0$ subspace.   Default is 100.
PHP is a subblock of the CI matrix which is calculated explicitly
in order to obtain improved CI trial vectors compared to the
straight Davidson algorithm\cite{erdjcp17}.  The configurations
corresponding to
the lowest diagonal elements are selected, unless \Key{PHPRESIDUAL} is
specified. MAXPHP is the maximum dimension of PHP, the
actual dimension will be less if MAXPHP will split degenerate configurations.

\item{\Key{MAXRM}}\\
\verb|READ *, MAXRM |\\
Change the maximum dimension of the reduced space. Default is 200.
When solving a linear system of equations or an eigenvalue equation,
the reduced space is increased by the number of
frequencies/excitations in each iteration. For single root
calculations this should exceed the number of iterations required.
MAXRM should be increased if many frequencies or excitation energies
are to be calculated.
Sharp convergence thresholds also require
more iterations and thus larger dimension of the reduced space.

\item{\Key{NOAVDI}}
Do not use Fock type decoupling of the two-electron density matrix.
Add $F^ID$ instead of $(F^I+F^A)D$ to $E^{[2]}$ approximate
orbital diagonal. Not recommended as the approximate orbital diagonal
normally will become more different from the exact orbital diagonal.

\item{\Key{NODOIT}}
Turns off direct one-index transformation \cite{ovhahjajjcc15}.
In this way all one-index transformed integrals are stored on disk.

\item{\Key{NOITRA}}
No integral transformation. Normally the two-electron integrals are
transformed in the beginning of a response calculation. In some cases
this is not desirable, {\it e.g.\/}, if the response part is only used for
calculating average values of an operator, or if the transformed two-electron
integrals already exist from a previous response calculation.

\item{\Key{OPTORB}}
Orbital trial vectors are calculated with optimal orbital
trial\index{optimal orbital trial vector} vector
algorithm \cite{tuhjahjajpjjcp84}.

\item{\Key{ORBSFT}}\\
\verb|READ *, ORBSFT|\\
Change the amount for shifting the orbital
diagonal\index{orbital diagonal Hessian} of the MCSCF Hessian.
May be used if there is a large number of negative eigenvalues.
Default is $10^{-4}$.

\item{\Key{ORBSPC}}
Calculation with only orbital operators.

\item{\Key{PHPRESIDUAL}}
Select configurations for PHP matrix based on largest residual
rather than lowest diagonal elements.

%\item[\Key{PROP2A}] Not yet implemented apparently.

\item{\Key{SOPPA}}
Requests the second order polarization propagator approximation
in the linear response module.
The SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator!SOPPA}\index{response!SOPPA}
flag requires that
the preceding {\sir} calculation has generated the MP2 correlation
coefficients and written them to disk (set \Key{RUN RESPONSE} in \Sec{*DALTON}
input as well as \Key{HF} and \Key{MP2} in \Sec{*WAVE FUNCTIONS}). See
example input in Chapter~\ref{ch:starting}.

\item{\Key{PROPAV}} \\
\verb|READ '(A)', LABEL|\\
Property average\index{property average}.
The average value of an electronic one-electron
operator is calculated.
(Thus, no nuclear contributions are added.)
The line following this option must contain the
label of the operator given in the integral property file.
(See section \ref{ch:hermit}.)

\item{\Key{QRREST}}
Restart quadratic response\index{quadratic response}\index{response!quadratic}
calculation.
Requires that all needed linear response solutions and excitation vectors
are available on the RSPVEC file.

\item{\Key{S0MIX}}
Sum rule is calculated in mixed representation, that is, calculate
$N_e=\langle0\mid [r,p] \mid0\rangle$ provided that dipole length and
velocity integrals are available on the property integral file
(calculated with \Sec{*HERMIT} options \Key{DIPLEN} and \Key{DIPVEL}).
The calculated quantity gives a measure of the quality of the basis
set\index{basis set!quality}.

\item{\Key{SOPPA(CCSD)}}
Requests the second order polarization propagator approximation with
coupled cluster singles and doubles amplitudes or the second order
polarization propagator approximation with CC2 amplitudes in the linear
response module. The SOPPA(CCSD)\index{SOPPA(CCSD)}\index{polarization
propagator!SOPPA(CCSD)}
\index{response!SOPPA(CCSD)} flag requires that the preceding coupled cluster
calculation has generated the CC2 or CCSD amplitudes and written them
to disk (set \Key{RUN RESPONSE} in \Sec{*DALTON} input, \Key{HF} and
\Key{CC} in \Sec{*WAVE FUNCTIONS}  and \Key{SOPPA2}
 or \Key{SOPPA(CCSD)} in \Sec{CC INPUT}). See example input in
Chapter~\ref{ch:starting}.

\item{\Key{SOPW4}}
Calculate explicitly the W4 term described by Oddershede {\it et
al.\/}~\cite{jopjdycpr2}. This term is already included in the normal
SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator!SOPPA} or
SOPPA(CCSD)\index{SOPPA(CCSD)} result, and used mostly for comparing to older
calculations. Note that this keyword requires that \Key{SOPPA} or
\Key{SOPPA(CCSD)}is set.

\item{\Key{TRPFLG}}
Triplet flag. This option is set whenever triplet
(spin-dependent)\index{triplet response}
operators must be used in a response calculation
\cite{jodlypjjcp91,ovhapjhjajthjojcp97}.
This flag forces triplet linear response for \Sec{LINEAR},
both for second order properties and electronic excitations
(without and with \Key{SINGLE RESIDUE}).

Default is 1.0D-3; note that this number should be at least 10 times
bigger than the final gradient norm in the SCF/MCSCF

quadrupole\index{quadrupole operator} operator, respectively.

\item{\Key{PRINT}}     \\
\verb|READ (LUCMD,*),IPRC6 |\\
   The line following gives the print level for the calculation of Cauchy moments.

\item{\Key{PROPRT}}\\
\verb|READ '(A)', LABEL|\\
Sets $A$ and $B$ to a given operator with label; LABEL.
(The calculation of the operator must be specified to the integral
module, see section \ref{ch:hermit}.)
This keyword may be repeated for different properties.

\item{\Key{THCC6}}\\
\verb|READ *, THCC6|\\
Relative convergence threshold for all requested linear response functions.
Default is 1.0D-3; note that this number should be at least 10 times
bigger than the final gradient norm in the SCF/MCSCF
wave function optimization.<
\end{description}


\noindent{\bf Comments:}

You must tell the integral module to calculate the necessary one-electron integrals.
For \Key{C8SPH}, \Key{C8ATM}, or \Key{C8LMO} you will need

\begin{verbatim}
**INTEGRALS
.SPHMOM
   3
\end{verbatim}

which calculate spherical moments for $L = 0, \ldots, 3$.
For the \Key{C6xxx} and the \Key{C10xxx} options
you will need $L = 0, 1$ and $L = 0, \ldots, 5$, respectively.

\label{sec:g-tensor}
Calculation of the electronic g-tensor:

\begin{description}
  \item{\Key{G-TENSOR}} \\
   Initializes input block for g-tensor related options
\end{description}
The default is to calculate all contributions. The following
options selects individual contributions
\begin{description}
   \item{\Key{RMC}}
   Relativistic mass correction
   \item{\Key{OZSO1}}
   Second-order (paramagnetic) orbital-Zeeman + 1-electron spin-orbit contributions

\end{description}
The following are utility options for modifying the default calculational
procedure.
\begin{description}
  \item{\Key{ADD-SO}}
  Adds the 1- and 2-electron spin-orbit operators. This
  option may be used when one is not interested in the individual
  1- and 2-electron contribution to the paramagnetic g-tensor,
  since it reduces the number of response equations to be solved.
   \item{\Key{MEAN-FIELD}}
   Uses the approximate atomic mean field (AMFI) spin-orbit operator
   for evaluating the paramagnetic contributions.
%   \item{\Key{OWN-OT}} Calculates separately the spin-own-orbit and
%   spin-other-orbit contributions to the 2-electron spin-orbit
%   operator contribution to the g tensor.
   \item{\Key{SCALED}}
   Uses the approximate 1-electron spin-orbit operator with scaled nuclear
   charges taken from Ref.~\cite{skmwsmsgjpca102} for evaluating the paramagnetic contributions.
%\item{\Key{TEST A}}
  \item{\Key{ZERO}}
  \verb|READ(LUCMD,'(A80)')G_LINE |\\
  This option is mainly for linear molecules in a $\Sigma$ state.
  Specifying e.g. "ZZ" on the input line instructs the program
  to skip the calculation of the paramagnetic contribution to $g_{zz}$.
