\section{Directives for evaluation of molecular response functions}\label{sec:rspinp}

The directives in the following subsections may be included in the input to \resp.
They are organized according to the program section names in which they
appear.

\resp\ is the most general part of the code for calculating 
many different electronic linear, quadratic, or cubic molecular
response properties based on SCF or MCSCF or CI wave functions.
No nuclear contributions are added.

Some of these SCF/MCSCF properties can also be requested
from \Sec{*PROPERTIES} input modules.
NOTE: for such properties you should request them either here or
in \Sec{*PROPERTIES}, otherwise you will calculate them twice!
Usually the output is nicest in
the \Sec{*PROPERTIES} module (e.g. collected in tables and in
often used units, most properties are only given in atomic
units in \resp), and nuclear contributions are included if relevant.
Some specific properties, especially those involving nuclear derivatives,
can only be calculated via \Sec{*PROPERTIES}.

Calculations of coupled cluster response properties are performed
by different modules and are described
in the chapter on coupled cluster calculations.

In addition, SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator}
(Second-Order Polarization Propagator 
approximation) for the calculation of linear response
\index{linear response}\index{response!linear}
properties may be requested in this input section. The current
implementation of the SOPPA method is described 
in Ref.~\cite{mjpekdtehjajjojcp}. Note that a SOPPA calculation
requires the keyword \Key{SOPPA}.

\subsection{General: \Sec{*RESPONSE}}

General-purpose directives are given in the \Sec{*RESPONSE} section.

After the last directive of the \Sec{*RESPONSE} input group
should follow another \Sec{*<something>} input group
(or \Sec{*END OF INPUT} if this was the last input to \dalton).

\begin{description}

\item{\Key{RSPCI}}
Configuration interaction\index{Configuration Interaction}\index{CI}
response calculation. 
This is equivalent to a CI sum-over-states calculation of response properties,
but of course calculated directly without diagonalization of the full
CI Hamiltonian matrix.
The final wave function from \Sec{*WAVE FUNCTIONS} must be \Key{CI}.

\item{\Key{SOPPA}}
Requests the second order polarization propagator approximation 
in the linear response module.
The SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator!SOPPA}\index{response!SOPPA}
flag requires that
the preceding {\sir} calculation has generated the MP2 correlation
coefficients and written them to disk (set \Key{RUN RESPONSE} in \Sec{*DALTON}
input as well as \Key{HF} and \Key{MP2} in \Sec{*WAVE FUNCTIONS}). See
example input in Chapter~\ref{ch:starting}.

\item{\Key{SOPW4}}
Calculate explicitly the W4 term described by Odderhede {\it et
al.\/}~\cite{jopjdlycpr2}. This term is already included in the normal
SOPPA\index{SOPPA}\index{polarization propagator!SOPPA} result, and used mostly for comparing to older
calculations. Note that this keyword requires that \Key{SOPPA} is set.

\item{\Key{HIRPA}}
Invoke the higher RPA approximation for the calculation of linear
response properties\index{linear response!higher RPA}.
This approximation is identical to that of McKoy
and coworkers~\cite{jrtsvmjcp58,tsjrvmjcp58}. The requirements to the
preceding wave function 
calculation is the same as for the \Key{SOPPA} keyword.
This keyword overrides a simultaneous specification of \Key{SOPPA}.

\item{\Key{TRPFLG}}
Triplet flag. This option is set whenever triplet
(spin-dependent)\index{triplet response}
operators must be used in a response calculation
\cite{jodlypjjcp91,ovhapjhjajthjojcp97}

\item{\Key{NOAVDI}}
Do not use Fock type decoupling of the two-electron density matrix.
Add $F^ID$ instead of $(F^I+F^A)D$ to $E^{[2]}$ approximate
orbital diagonal. 

\item{\Key{INPTES}}
Input test. For debugging purposes only. The program stops after the
input section.

\item{\Key{MAXPHP}}\\
\verb|READ *, MAXPHP|\\
Change the maximum dimension of $H_0$ subspace.   Default is 100.
PHP is a subblock of the CI matrix which is calculated explicitly
in order to obtain improved CI trial vectors compared to the
straight Davidson algorithm\cite{erdjcp17}.  The configurations
corresponding to 
the lowest diagonal elements are selected, unless \Key{PHPRESIDUAL} is
specified. MAXPHP is the maximum dimension of PHP, the 
actual dimension will be less if MAXPHP will split degenerate configurations.
 
\item{\Key{MAXRM}}\\
\verb|READ *, MAXRM |\\
Change the maximum dimension of the reduced space. Default is 200.
When solving a linear system of equations or an eigenvalue equation,
the reduced space is increased by the number of
frequencies/excitations in each iteration. For single root
calculations this should exceed the number of iterations required.
MAXRM should be increased if many frequencies or excitation energies
are to be calculated.
Sharp convergence thresholds also requires
more iterations and thus larger dimension of reduced space.

\item{\Key{NODOIT}}
Turns off direct one-index transformation \cite{ovhahjajjcc15}. 
In this way all one-index transformed integrals are stored on disk.

\item{\Key{NOITRA}}
No integral transformation. Normally the two-electron integrals are 
transformed in the beginning of a response calculation. In some cases
this is not desirable, e.g., if the response part is only used for
calculating average values of operator, or if the transformed two-electron
integrals already exist from a previous response calculation. 

\item{\Key{S0MIX}}
Sum rule is calculated in mixed representation, that is, calculate
$N_e=\langle0\mid [r,p] \mid0\rangle$ provided that dipole length and
velocity integrals are available on the property integral file 
(calculated with \Sec{*HERMIT} options \Key{DIPLEN} and \Key{DIPVEL}).
The calculated quantity gives a measure of the quality of the basis
set\index{basis set!quality}.

\item{\Key{OPTORB}}
Orbital trial vectors are calculated with optimal orbital
trial\index{optimal orbital trial vector} vector
algorithm \cite{tuhjahjajpjjcp84}.

\item{\Key{ORBSFT}}\\
\verb|READ *, ORBSFT|\\
Change the amount for shifting the orbital
diagonal\index{orbital diagonal Hessian} of the MCSCF Hessian.
May be used if there is a large number of negative eigenvalues.
Default is $10^{-4}$. 

\item{\Key{ORBSPC}}
Calculation with only orbital operators. 

\item{\Key{PHPRESIDUAL}}
Select configurations for PHP matrix based on largest residual
rather than lowest diagonal elements.

\item{\Key{PROPAV}} \\
\verb|READ '(A)', LABEL|\\
Property average\index{property average}. The average value of an
operator is calculated. 
The line following this option must contain the
label of the operator given in the integral property file.
(See section \ref{ch:hermit}.)

\item{\Key{QRREST}}
Restart quadratic response\index{quadratic response}\index{response!quadratic}
calculation.
\end{description}

Single residues\index{single residue} of the linear
response\index{linear response!single residue}\index{response!excitations} function is

transition moments\index{transition moment} and the associated poles
correspond to vertical electronic excitation energies.
%\cite{jodlypjjcp91,pjhjajjojcp89}

In the same \resp\ calculation these excitation properties can be calculated
together with linear response properties
and with long range dispersion coefficients, but not 
together with quadratic or cubic response.

equation. Default is 60.

\item{\Key{MAXITO}}\\

\cite{tuhjahjajpjjcp84}. 
Default is 5.
