In the \Sec{CCLR} section the input that is
specific for coupled cluster linear response properties is read in. 
This section includes presently 
\begin{itemize}
\item frequency-dependent linear response properties 
      $\alpha_{AB}(\omega)  = - \langle\langle A; B \rangle\rangle_\omega$
      where $A$ and $B$ can be any of the one-electron
      operators for which integrals are available in the 
      \Sec{*INTEGRALS} input part.
\item dispersion coefficients $D_{AB}(n)$ for $\alpha_{AB}(\omega)$
      which for $n \ge 0$ are defined by the expansion
      $$ \alpha_{AB}(\omega) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \omega^n \, D_{AB}(n) $$
      In addition to the dispersion coefficients for $n \ge 0$
      there are also coefficients available for $ n = -1, \ldots, -4$,
      which are related to the Cauchy moments
       by $ D_{AB}(n) = S_{AB}(-n-2)$.
      \\
      Note, that for real response functions only even moments
      $D_{AB}(2n) = S_{AB}(-2n-2)$ with $n \ge -2$ are available,
      while for imaginary response functions only odd moments
      $D_{AB}(2n+1) = S_{AB}(-2n-3)$ with $n \ge -2$ are available.
\end{itemize}
Coupled cluster linear response functions and dispersion coefficients
are implemented for the models CCS, CC2 and CCSD. 
%Publications that report results obtained with CC linear response
%calculations should cite Ref.\ \cite{Christiansen:CCLR}. 
The theoretical background for the implementation is detailed in Ref.\ \cite{Christiansen:CCLR,Christiansen:QEL,Haettig:CAUCHY}.
%For dispersion coefficients also a citation of Ref.\ \cite{Haettig:CAUCHY} 
%should be included.
The properties calculated are in the approach now generally known as coupled cluster 
linear response---in the frequency-independent limit this coincides with the so-called 
orbital-unrelaxed energy derivatives (and thus the orbital-unrelaxed finite field result).

\item[\Key{ASYMSD}] 
Use an asymmetric formulation of the linear response function which
does not require the solution of response equations for the operators $A$, 
but solves two sets of response equations for the operators $B$.

   \verb|READ (LUCMD,'(A)') AVERAGE|\newline
   \verb|READ (LUCMD,'(A)') SYMMETRY|

Evaluate special tensor averages of linear response functions.
Presently implemented are the isotropic average of the dipole polarizability
$\bar{\alpha}$ and the dipole polarizability anisotropy $\alpha_{ani}$.
Specify \verb+ALPHA_ISO+ for \verb+AVERAGE+ to obtain $\bar{\alpha}$ and
\verb+ALPHA_ANI+ to obtain $\alpha_{ani}$ and $\bar{\alpha}$.
The \verb+SYMMETRY+ input defines the selection rules that can be
exploited to reduce the number of tensor elements that have to be
evaluated. Available options are
\verb+ATOM+, \verb+SPHTOP+ (spherical top), \verb+LINEAR+,
\verb+XYDEGN+ ($x$- and $y$-axis equivalent, {\it i.e.\/} a $C_z^n$
symmetry axis with $n \ge 3$),  and \verb+GENER+ (use point
group symmetry from geometry input).

(max. 6 components).
