In the \Sec{CCCR} section the input that is  specific for 
coupled cluster cubic response properties is read in.
This section includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item frequency-dependent fourth-order properties
      $$ \gamma_{ABCD}(\omega_A;\omega_B,\omega_C,\omega_D) = -
           \langle\langle A;B,C,D\rangle\rangle_{\omega_B,\omega_C,\omega_D}
         \quad \mbox{with~} \omega_A = -\omega_B -\omega_C -\omega_D
      $$
      where $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ can be any of the one-electron
      operators for which integrals are available in the 
      \Sec{*INTEGRALS} input part.
      \index{fourth-order properties}
\item dispersion coefficients $D_{ABCD}(l,m,n)$ for 
      $ \gamma_{ABCD}(\omega_A;\omega_B,\omega_C,\omega_D) $
      which for $n \ge 0$ are defined by the expansion 
      $$ \gamma_{ABCD}(\omega_A;\omega_B,\omega_C,\omega_D) = 
          \sum_{l,m,n=0}^{\infty} \omega_B^l \, \omega_C^m \, \omega_D^n
            D_{ABCD}(l,m,n) $$
      \index{dispersion coefficients}
\end{itemize}
Coupled cluster cubic response functions and dispersion coefficients
are implemented for the models CCS, CC2 and CCSD.
%Publications that report results obtained with CC cubic response
%calculations should cite Ref.\ \cite{Haettig:CCCR}.
%For dispersion coefficients also a citation of Ref.\
%\cite{Haettig:DISPGAMMA} should be included.

The response functions are evaluated for a number of operator quadruples
(specified with the keywords \Key{OPERAT}, \Key{DIPOLE}, or \Key{AVERAG})
which are combined with triples of frequency arguments specified
using the keywords \Key{MIXFRE}, \Key{THGFRE}, \Key{ESHGFR}, \Key{DFWMFR},
\Key{DCKERR}, or \Key{STATIC}. The different frequency keywords are 
compatible and might be arbitrarily combined or repeated.
For dispersion coefficients use the keyword \Key{DISPCF}.

\item[\Key{AVERAG}] \verb| |\newline
\verb|READ (LUCMD,'(A)') AVERAGE|\newline
\verb|READ (LUCMD,'(A)') SYMMETRY|

Evaluate special tensor averages of cubic response functions.
Presently implemented are the isotropic averages of the second
dipole hyperpolarizability
$\gamma_{||}$ and $\gamma_{\bot}$.
Set \verb+AVERAGE+ to \verb+GAMMA_PAR+ 
to obtain $\gamma_{||}$ and to
\verb+GAMMA_ISO+ to obtain $\gamma_{||}$ and $\gamma_{\bot}$.
The \verb+SYMMETRY+ input defines the selection rules 
exploited to reduce the number of tensor elements that have to be
evaluated. Available options are
\verb+ATOM+, \verb+SPHTOP+ (spherical top), \verb+LINEAR+,
and \verb+GENER+ (use point group symmetry from geometry input).
Note that the \Key{AVERAG} option should be specified in the \Sec{CCCR}
section before any \Key{OPERAT} or \Key{DIPOLE} input.
