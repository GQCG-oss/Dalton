In this section keywords for the coupled
cluster program are defined. In particular the coupled cluster 
model(s) and other parameters common to all submodules are specified.

\begin{description}
\item[\Key{B0SKIP}] 
   Skip the calculation of the $B0$-vectors 
   in a restarted run. See comments under \verb|.IMSKIP|.

\item[\Key{CC(2)}]  
        Run calculation for non-iterative CC2 excitation energy model 
        (which is actually the well-known CIS(D) model).
 
\item[\Key{CC(3)}]  
       Run calculation for CC(3) ground state energy model.

        \index{CC2}
 
\item[\Key{CC3}]     
        Run calculation for CC3 model.
        \index{CC3}
%
\item[\Key{CCD}]    
        Run calculation for Coupled Cluster Doubles
        (CCD) model. 
        \index{Coupled Cluster!Doubles}
        \index{CCD}

        \index{CIS}
%
\item[\Key{CCR(3)}] 
        Run calculation for CCSDR(3) excitation energy model.
%
\item[\Key{CCS}]

        (CCS) model.

        (CCSD) model. 
        \index{Coupled Cluster!Singles and Doubles}
        \index{CCSD}
%
\item[\Key{CCSTST}] 
   Test option which runs the CCS finite field calculation as a pseudo CC2
   calculation. \verb+CCSTST+ disables all terms which depend on the
   double excitation amplitudes or multipliers. This flag must be
   set for CCS finite field calculations.
   \index{CCS}
   \index{finite field}
%
\item[\Key{DEBUG}]  
   Test option: print additional debug output.
%
\item[\Key{E0SKIP}] 
   Skip the calculation of the $E0$-vectors 
   in a restarted run. See comment under \verb|.IMSKIP|.
%
\item[\Key{F1SKIP}] 
   Skip the calculation of F-matrix transformed first-order
   cluster amplitude responses in a restarted run. See comment under \verb|.IMSKIP|.
%
\item[\Key{F2SKIP}] 
   Skip the calculation of F-matrix transformed second-order
   cluster amplitude responses in a restarted run. See comment under \verb|.IMSKIP|.
%
\item[\Key{FIELD}] \verb| |\newline
    \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) EFIELD|\newline
    \verb|READ (LUCMD,'(1X,A8)') LFIELD|

    Include external finite field (operator label \verb+EFIELD+)
    of strength \verb+EFIELD+. Note that this field is only included
    in the CC part of the calculation and not in the calculation of the
    SCF reference state. Using this option for calculation of finite field energy
    derivatives thus gives results corresponding to what is standard for the coupled cluster
    response function or orbital-unrelaxed energy derivatives.
    Note also that this way of adding an external field does not work for models including
    triples excitations (most notably CCSD(T), CC3).
    For finite field calculations of orbital relaxed energy derivatives the field
    should also be added in the SCF wave function part.

    \index{external field}
 
\item[\Key{FREEZE}] \verb| |\newline
      \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) NFC, NFV|

     Specify the number of frozen core orbitals and number of frozen virtuals (0 is recommended for the latter).
     The program will automatically freeze the NFC(NFV) orbitals of lowest (highest) orbital energy
     among the canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals.
     For benzene a relevant choice is for example 6 0.

      Specify for each irreducible representation how
      many orbitals should be frozen (deleted) for the coupled
      cluster calculation. In calculations, the first \verb+NRHFFR(I)+
      orbitals will be kept frozen in symmetry class \verb+I+ and
      the last \verb+NVIRFR(I)+ orbitals will be deleted from the 
      orbital list.
 
\item[\Key{FROEXP}]  \verb| |\newline
    \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) (NRHFFR(I),I=1,MSYM)|\newline
    \verb|DO ISYM = 1, MSYM|\newline
    \verb|  IF (NRHFFR(ISYM.NE.0) THEN|\newline
    \verb|    READ (LUCMD,*) (KFRRHF(J,ISYM),J=1,NRHFFR(ISYM))|\newline
    \verb|  END IF|\newline
    \verb|END DO|\newline
    \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) (NVIRFR(I),I=1,MSYM)|\newline
    \verb|DO ISYM = 1, MSYM|\newline
    \verb|  IF (NVIRFR(ISYM.NE.0) THEN|\newline
    \verb|    READ (LUCMD,*) (KFRVIR(J,ISYM),J=1,NVIRFR(ISYM))|\newline
    \verb|  END IF|\newline
    \verb|END DO|

    Specify explicitly for each irreducible representation the
    orbitals that should be frozen (deleted) in the coupled cluster
    calculation.
 
\item[\Key{FRSKIP}] 
   Skip the calculation of the F-matrix transformed right eigenvectors
   in a restarted run. See comment under \verb|.IMSKIP|.
%
\item[\Key{HERDIR}] 
       Run coupled cluster program AO-direct\index{integral direct}
       using {\her}
       (Default is to run the program only AO integral direct
       if the \verb+DIRECT+ keyword was set in the general
       input section of \siraba . If \verb+HERDIR+ is not specified the \eri\
       program is used as integral generator.) 
%
\item[\Key{IMSKIP}] 
   Skip the calculation of some response intermediates in a restarted run.
   This options and the following skip options is primarily for very experienced users 
   and programmers who want to save a little bit of CPU time in restarts on very large 
   calculations. 
   {\em It is assumed that the user knows what he is doing when using these options, and
   the program does not test if the intermediates are there or are correct. 
   The relevant quantities are assumed to be at the correct directory and files.
   These comments also applies for all the other skip options following! }

   multipliers in a restarted run. See comment under \verb|.IMSKIP|.

%(And the corresponding logical variables on a seperate 
%common block.)
