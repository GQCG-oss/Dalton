In the \Sec{CCEXGR} section the input that is specific for coupled cluster 
response calculation of excited state first order properties is read in.
This section includes presently for example calculation of excited state 
dipole moments and second moments of the electronic charge distribution.
In many case the information generated in this way is very helpful 
for making qualitative assignments of the electronic states.
Perhaps in conjunction with the oscillator strengths and the 
orbital analysis of the response eigenvectors presented in the output.

The excited state properties are available for the models CCS, CC2 and CCSD,
but only for singlet states.
Publications that report results obtained this module should cite Ref.\ \cite{Christiansen:CCLR}.
The theoretical background for the implementation is detailed in Ref.\ \cite{Christiansen:QEL}.
This section has to be used in connection with \Sec{CCEXCI} for the calculation of excited states.

The properties calculated are in the approach now generally known as coupled cluster
response - for these frequency independent properties this coincides with so-called
orbital-unrelaxed energy derivatives (and thus the orbital-unrelaxed finite field result)
for the excited state total energies as obtained by the sum of the CC ground state energy
and the CC response excitation energy.

{\bf Note of caution:}
Default in this section is therefore orbital {\it unrelaxed}, while for the ground state 
first order properties \Sec{CCFOP} default is {\it relaxed}. 
To find results in a consistent approximation turn orbital relaxation of
for the ground state (for CCS, CC2, CCSD) calculation.

\item[\Key{SELEXC}] 

Select which excited states the calculation of excited state properties 
are carried out for. The default is all states according to the CCEXCI input section.
For calculating for selected states only,
provide a list of symmetry and state numbers (order after increasing energy in
each symmetry class).
This list is read until next input label is found in the following format\\
