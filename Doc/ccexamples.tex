\chapter{Examples of coupled cluster calculations}
\label{ch:ccexamples}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We collect in this Chapter a few examples of input files (\verb|DALTON.INP|) 
for calculations one might want to carry 
out with the \cc\ modules of the Dalton program.
Other examples may be found in the test suite. 

It should be stressed that in difference to the \resp \ code,
all modules in \cc \ can be used 
simultaneously---assuming they are all implemented
for the chosen wavefunction model(s).
For instance,  linear, quadratic and cubic response functions 
can be obtained within the same calculation.

\section{Multiple model energy calculations}
%
\cc\  allows for the calculation of the ground state energy
of the given system using a variety of wavefunction models, listed in 
Section~\ref{sec:ccgeneral}. 
For any model specified the Hartree--Fock energy is always calculated. 
The following input describes the calculation of SCF, MP2, CCSD and 
CCSD(T) ground state energies:
%
\begin{verbatim}
**GENERAL
.RUN WAVE FUNCTION
**WAVE FUNCTIONS
.CC
*CC INPUT
.MP2              
.CCSD
.CC(T)
*END OF INPUT
\end{verbatim}
Note that SCF, MP2 and CCSD energies are obtained by default if 
CCSD(T) (\Key{CC(T)}) is required. Therefore the 
keywords \Key{MP2} and \Key{CCSD}
may also be omitted in the previous example.

\section{First-order property calculation}

The following input exemplifies the calculation of all orbital-relaxed
first-order one-electron properties available in \cc, for the hierarchy of 
wavefunction models SCF (indirectly obtained through CCS), MP2 and CCSD.
For details, see Section~\ref{sec:ccfop}.
\begin{verbatim}

.EFGCAR
.DARWIN
.MASSVELO
**WAVE FUNCTIONS

*CC INPUT
.CCS              (gives SCF First order properties)
.MP2              (default if CCSD is calculated)
.CCSD
*CCFOP
.ALLONE
*END OF INPUT
\end{verbatim}

\section{Static and frequency-dependent dipole polarizabilities and
            corresponding dispersion coefficients} 

The following input describes the calculation of the 
electric dipole polarizability component $\alpha_{zz}(\omega)$, 
for $\omega = 0.00$ and $\omega=0.072$ au, and its dispersion
coefficients up to order 6, in the hierarchy of CC models
CCS, CC2 and CCSD. 
The calculation of the electric dipole moment has been
included in the same run.

\end{verbatim}

\section{Static and frequency-dependent dipole hyperpolariza\-bil\-ities 
            and corresponding dispersion coefficients} 

The previous input can be extended to include the 
calculation of the electric first and second hyperpolarizability components 
$\beta_{zzz}(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ and 
$\gamma_{zzzz}(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3)$, 
for $\omega_1 = \omega_2 =(\omega_3 =) \ 0.00$ 
and $\omega_1 = \omega_2 =(\omega_3 =) \ 0.072$ au. 
The corresponding dispersion coefficients up to sixth order are also calculated.
For other specific cases, see Sections~\ref{sec:ccqr} and \ref{sec:cccr}

\end{verbatim}
Obviously, linear, quadratic and cubic response modules can also be
run separately. 

\section{Excitation energies and oscillator strengths}
This is an example for the calculation of singlet excitation energy and
oscillator strength for a system with \verb+NSYM = 2+ (C$_s$).
\begin{verbatim}
**GENERAL
.RUN WAVE FUNCTION
**INTEGRAL
.DIPLEN
**WAVE FUNCTIONS

.CCSD

*CCEXCI
.NCCEXCI                !number of excited states
 2 1                    !2 states in symmetry 1 and 1 state in symmetry 2
*CCLRSD
.DIPOLE
*END OF INPUT
\end{verbatim}
Triplet excitation energies can be obtained adding
an extra line to \Key{NCCEXCI} specifying the number 
of required triplet excited states for each symmetry class.  
Note however that linear residues are not available
for triplet states (The \Sec{CCLRSD} sections should be removed).

\section{Gradient calculation, geometry optimization}
Available for CCS, CC2, MP2, CCSD using integral direct analytic gradient.

\noindent For a single integral-direct gradient calculation:
\begin{verbatim}
**GENERAL

.DEROVL
.DERHAM
**WAVE FUNCTION

*ORBITAL INPUT
.NOSUPSYM

*END OF
\end{verbatim}
Note that if several wavefunction models are specified, 
the gradient calculation is performed only for the ``lowest-level" 
model in the list.

\noindent For a geometry optimization:
\begin{verbatim}
