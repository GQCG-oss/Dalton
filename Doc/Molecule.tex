\chapter{\mol\ input style}\label{ch:molinp}

The \mol-style input is originally based on the input for the \mol\
integral program by Alml\"{o}f~\cite{moleculeref}. However, except for
some lines still requiring formatted input, there are few remnants of
the original input structure.
The program supports both Cartesian\index{cartesian coordinate input}
and Z-matrix input\index{Z-matrix input} of the
molecular coordinates. However, the Z-matrix input provided is only a
convenient way of describing the molecular geometry, as the Z-matrix is
converted to Cartesian coordinates, which are then used in the
subsequent calculations. Note  that the Z-matrix input can only be
used together with the basis set library.

The program includes an extensive basis set
library\index{basis set library},  and
additional possibilities for choosing the number of primitive
and contracted orbitals to be used with the Atomic Natural Orbital
(ANO) basis sets\index{ANO basis set} and the ``Not Quite van
Duijneveldt'' (NQvD) basis
sets\index{NQvD basis set}. The large number of different basis sets
provided is in part
related to the variety of molecular properties with very different
basis set requirements that can be calculated with \siraba .
Most of the basis sets have been downloaded from the EMSL basis set
library service\newline
(http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/forms/basisform.html)~\cite{emslref}.
Only six of the basis sets were obtained from different sources:

\begin{list}{--}{}
\item The ano-1, ano-2, ano-3, ano-4 and sadlej basis sets which where
downloaded from the MOLCAS home-page
(http://garm.teokem.lu.se/MOLCAS/).
\item The NQvD (The Not Quite van Duijneveldt) basis sets, constructed
by Knut F\ae gri for this distribution~\cite{nqvdref}.
\end{list}

We note that each file containing a given basis sets contains the
proper reference to be used when doing a calculation with a given
basis set. We will give proper references for all basis sets in a
subsequent chapter describing the input for the basis  set library.

The description of the \mol\ input is divided into four parts.
Section~\ref{sec:molgeneral} describes the general section of the
molecule input,
section~\ref{sec:molcart} describes the Cartesian coordinate
input\index{cartesian coordinate input},
section~\ref{sec:molzmat} describes the Z-matrix input\index{Z-matrix
input}, and finally
Section~\ref{sec:molbasis} describes the basis set library\index{basis
set library}.

\section{General \mol\ input}\label{sec:molgeneral}

In the general input section of the \mol\ input file, we will consider
such information as molecular symmetry\index{symmetry}, number of
symmetry distinct atoms\index{symmetry-distinct atom}, generators of a
given molecular point group\index{symmetry generator}\index{symmetry
group}, and so on.
This information usually constitutes the four/five first lines of the
input, and is {\em formatted}.

The input is best described by an example.
The following is the first lines of an input for
tetrahedrane\index{tetrahedrane}, treated in
$C_{2v}$~symmetry, with a 4-31G** basis.  The line numbers are for
convenience in the subsequent input description and should {\em
not} appear in the actual input.  Note also that in order to fit
the example across the page some liberties have been taken with
column spacings.
\begin{verbatim}
 1:INTGRL
 2:        Tetrahedrane, Td_symmetric geometry
 3:                 4-31G** basis
 4:    2    2  X  Y  Z   1.00D-15
\end{verbatim}

We now define the input line-by-line.  The {\tt FORMAT} is given
in parentheses.
\begin{description}
\item[1] The word \verb|INTGRL| {\tt (A6)}.
\item[2-3] Two arbitrary title lines {\tt (A72)}.
\item[4] \verb|CRT,NONTYP,KCHARG,SYMTXT,((KASYM(I,J),I=1,3),J=1,3), ID3, THRS|
{\tt (A1,I4,I3,A2,10A1,D10.2)}.
\begin{description}
\item[CRT] By giving a small or capital 'C' in this
position, the program will use Cartesian Gaussian basis
functions\index{cartesian basis function} instead of
the default, which is Spherical Gaussian basis
functions\index{spherical basis function}\index{basis function}.
\item[NONTYP] Number of atom types (number of atoms specified
in separate blocks). For a Z-matrix input this will be the total
number of atoms in the molecule.
\item[KCHARG] The charge of the molecule\index{charge of
molecule}. Will be used  by
the program to determine the Hartree-Fock occupation. A zero is
assumed if no number is given here.
\item[SYMTXT] Number of symmetry generators\index{symmetry
generator}. If this field is
left blank, the automatic symmetry detection\index{symmetry detection}
routines of the program will be
invoked. Symmetry can be turned off (needed for instance if starting a
walk at a highly symmetric structure which one knows will break
symmetry) by typing a zero in this place. Any other number will be
interpreted as the number of symmetry generators (1--3).
\item[KASYM] Symmetry generators\index{symmetry generator}.  {\tt X}
is reflection\index{reflection}
in the \mbox{$yz$-plane}, {\tt XY} is rotation\index{rotation} about
the \mbox{$z$-axis},
and {\tt XYZ} denotes inversion\index{inversion}. Due to the handling
of symmetry in
the program, it is recommended to use mirror planes as symmetry
generating elements if possible.

\item[ID3] A number in this place indicates that the
coordinates of the atoms will be read in \AA ngstr\"{o}m\index{\AA
ngstr\"{o}m}, and not in
atomic units which is the default.
\item[THR] Threshold for neglect of final integrals. Default
is 1.0D-15, which will be used if no input is given here. A threshold
of 1.0D-15 will give integrals correct to approximately 1.0D-13.
\end{description}
\end{description}

Note that if one wants to use the basis set library\index{basis set
library}, there are two
options. One option is to use a common basis set for the entire
molecule in which the first line should be replaced by two lines,
which for a calculation using the 4-31G** basis would look like:
\begin{verbatim}
 1:BASIS
 2:4-31G**
\end{verbatim}
This option will not be active with customizable basis sets like the
ANO or NQvD sets.

Alternatively you may specify different basis sets for different
atoms, in which case the first line should read
\begin{verbatim}
 1:ATOMBASIS
\end{verbatim}

The fourth line (fifth in a calculation using the basis set library)
looks a bit devastating. However, for ordinary
Hartree-Fock\index{HF}\index{MP2}\index{SCF}\index{Hartree-Fock}\index{M\o
ller-Plesset} or MP2
calculations, only the number of different atom types and the charge
need to be given (if the molecule is charged), as symmetry and
Hartree-Fock occupation\index{HF occupation}\index{Hartree-Fock
occupation} will be taken
care of by the program. Thus
this line could in the above example be reduced to
\begin{verbatim}
 4:    2
\end{verbatim}

Let us finally give some remarks about the symmetry
detection\index{symmetry detection}
routines. These routines will detect any symmetry of a molecule
by explicit testing for the occurrence of rotation axes, mirror planes
and center of inversion. The occurrence of a symmetry element is
tested in the program against a threshold which may be adjusted by the
keyword \Key{SYMTHR} in the \Sec{READIN} input section. By default,
the program will require
geometries that are correct to the sixth decimal place in order to
detect all symmetry elements.

The program will translate and rotate the molecule into a suitable
reference geometry before testing for the occurrence of symmetry
operations. The program will not, due to the handling of symmetry
in the program, transform  the molecule back to original input
coordinates. Furthermore, if there are symmetry equivalent nuclei,
these will be removed from the input, and a new, standardized
molecule input file will be generated and used in subsequent
iterations of for instance a geometry optimization. This
standardized input file (including basis set) can be printed to
the file \verb|DALTON.BAS| by using the keyword \Key{MOLPRI} in
the \Sec{READIN} submodule.

\siraba\ can only take advantage of point groups that are subgroups
of D$_{2h}$. If symmetry higher than that is detected, the program
will use the highest common subgroup of  the symmetry group
detected and D$_{2h}$.

We recommend that the automatic symmetry detection feature is not
used when doing MCSCF\index{MCSCF} calculations, as symmetry
generators\index{symmetry generator} and their order in the input
determines the order of the irreducible \typeout{Sonia: it was
"irreproducible", I changed it to irreducible} representations
needed when specifying active spaces. Thus, for MCSCF calculations
we recommend that the symmetry is  explicitly specified through
the appropriate symmetry generators, as well as the explicit
Hartree-Fock occupation numbers.

\section{Cartesian geometry input}\label{sec:molcart}\index{cartesian
coordinate input}

Assuming that we have given the general input as indicated above, we
now want to specify the spatial arrangements of the atoms in a
Cartesian coordinate system. We will also for sake of illustration
assume that we have given explicitly the generators of the point group
to be used in the calculation (in this case C$_{2v}$, with the yz- and
xz-planes as mirror planes).

In tetrahedrane we will have two different kinds of atoms, carbon
and hydrogen, as indicated by the number 2 on the fourth (fifth)
line of the input. We will also assume that we punch the basis set
ourselves, in order to present the input format for the basis set.

For tetrahedrane, the input would then look like
\begin{verbatim}
 5:        6.    2    3    1    1    1
 6:C1    1.379495419          .0                 0.975450565

32:    1    1
33:0.75       1.0
\end{verbatim}

The different lines are:
\begin{description}
\item[5] \verb|ZMATL, CHARGE, NUMBER, MAXL, NGRP(I)|
{\tt (BN,A6,F4.0,24I5)}.
\begin{description}
\item[ZMATL] This field must be left blank when Cartesian
coordinate input\index{cartesian coordinate input} is used as the field
is used for checking whether
Cartesian coordinates or Z-matrix\index{Z-matrix input} input is being
used. Characters
placed in this field will tell the program to use Z-matrix input.
\item[CHARGE] Charge of this atom\index{charge of atom} type.
\item[NUMBER] Number of {\em symmetry-distinct}\index{symmetry-distinct atom} atoms of
this type (or, if the symmetry detection routines are being used, all
atoms of this kind).
\item[MAXL] Maximum angular quantum number used in the
basis set for this atom type ($s=1$, $p=2$, etc.). Not required if the
basis set library is being used.
\item[NGRP(I)] Number of groups (blocks) of generally contracted
functions of angular quantum number~{\tt I}. The loop is over MAXL. Not
required if the basis set library is used. It is noteworthy that
\siraba\ collects all basis functions into one such shell, and
evaluates all integrals arising from that shell\index{shell of basis
functions} simultaneously, and
the memory requirements grow rapidly with the number of basis
functions in a shell (note for instance that four $g$ functions
actually are 36
basis functions, as there are 9 components of each $g$
function). Memory requirements\index{memory} can therefore be reduced
by splitting
basis functions of the quantum number into different blocks. However,
this will decrease the performance of the integral\index{performance
of integral program} calculation.
\end{description}
\item[6] \verb|NAME, X, Y, Z, FLAG| {\tt (A4,3F20.15)}
\begin{description}
\item[NAME] Atom name.  A different name should be used for
each atom of the same type, although this is not required.
\item[X] $x$-coordinate (in atomic units, unless \AA ngstr\"{o}m
has been requested on line $4$ of the input).
\item[Y] $y$-coordinate.
\item[Z] $z$-coordinate.
\end{description}
The Cartesian coordinates may
be given in free format. However, {\em the name of the atom must still be
left four places}, and no coordinates must enter the four first
positions.
\item[7] This is the other symmetry-distinct center of this type.
\item[8] \verb|FRMT, NPRIM, NCONT, NOINT| {\tt (A1,I4,2I5)}.
\begin{description}
\item[FRMT] A single character describing the input format of the
basis set in this block. The default format is {\tt (8F10.4)} which
will be used if {\tt FRMT} is left blank. In this format
the first column is the orbital exponent and the seven last columns
are contraction coefficients. If no numbers are given, a zero is
assumed. If more than 7 contracted functions occur in a given block,
the contraction coefficients may be continued on the next line, but
the first column (where the orbital exponents are given) must then be
left blank.

An {\tt F} or {\tt f} in the first position will indicate that the
input is in free format. This will of course require that all
contraction coefficients need to be typed in, as all numbers need
to be present on each line. However, note that this options is
particularly handy together with completely decontracted basis
sets, as described below. Note that the program reads the free
format input from an internal file that is 80 characters long, and
no line can therefore exceed 80 characters.

One may also give the format {\tt H} or {\tt h}. This corresponds to
high precision format {\tt (4F20.8)}, where the first column again is
reserved for the orbital exponents, and the three next lines are
designated to the contraction coefficients. If no number is given, a zero
is assumed. If there are more than three contracted orbitals in a
given block, the contraction coefficients may be continued on the next
line, though keeping the column of the orbital exponents blank.

\item[NPRIM] Number of primitive\index{primitive basis function}
Gaussians in this block.
\item[NCONT] Number of contracted\index{contracted basis function}
Gaussians in this block. If a zero
is given, an uncontracted basis set will be assumed, and only orbital
exponents need to be given.
\end{description}
\item[9] \verb|EXP, (CONT(I), I=1,NCONT)|
\begin{description}
\item[EXP] Exponent of this primitive.
\item[CONT(I)] Coefficient of this primitive in contracted
function~{\tt I}.
\end{description}
We note that the format of the orbital exponents\index{orbital
exponent} and the contraction\index{contraction coefficient}
coefficients are determined from the value of {\tt FRMT} defined on
line~8.
\item[10-16] These lines complete the specification of this
contraction block: the $s$~basis here.
\item[17-21] New contraction block (see lines~8 and~9 above).
\item[22-23] New contraction block.
\item[24-33] Specifies a new atom type: coordinates and basis set.
\end{description}

\section{Z-matrix input}\label{sec:molzmat}

The Z-matrix input\index{Z-matrix input} provided with \siraba\ is
very rudimentary, and
common options like parameter representations of bond length and
angles as well as dummy atoms are currently not provided. Furthermore,
the Z-matrix input is not used in the program, but instead immediately
converted to Cartesian coordinates which are then used in the
subsequent calculation.
Another restriction is that if Z-matrix input is used, one cannot
punch ones own basis set, but must instead resort to basis sets
provided with the basis set library.

The input format is free, with, once more,
the restriction that the name of each atom must be of be given a space
of 4 characters, and none of the other input variables needed must be
placed in these positions.

The program will use Z-matrix input\index{Z-matrix input} if there are
any characters
in the first 4 positions of line 6 in the molecule input, and it is
important that these positions are kept blank if a Cartesian coordinate
input is  used.

A typical Z-matrix input could be:
\begin{verbatim}
BASIS
6-31G(d,p)
Test input of ammonia
6-31G(d,p) basis set
    4
N   1 7.0
H1  2 1 1.0116 1.0
H2  3 1 1.0116 2 106.7 1.0
H3  4 1 1.0116 2 106.7 3 106.7 1 1.0
\end{verbatim}
The five first lines should be familiar by now, and will be discussed
no further here. The Z-matrix input starts on line 6, and on the first
line only the atom name, a running number and the charge of the
atom\index{charge of atom}
is given. The running number is only for
ease of reference to a given atom, and is actually not used within the
program, where any reference to an atom, is  the number of the
atom consecutively in the input list.

The second line consists of the atom name, a running number, the
number of the atom to which this atom is bonded with a given bond
length, and then finally the charge of this atom.

The third line is identical to the second, except that an extra atom
number, to which the two first atoms on this line is bonded to with a
given bond angle.

On the fourth line yet another atom has been added, and the position
of this atom relative to the three previous ones on this line is
dependent upon on an extra number inserted just before the nuclear
charge of this atom. If the next to last number is a 0, the
position of this atom is given by the dihedral angle {\tt
(A1,A2,A3,A4)}, where {\tt Ai} denotes atom {\tt i}. If, on the other
hand, this next to last number is $\pm 1$, the position of the fourth
atom is given with respect to two angles, namely {\tt (A1,A2,A3)} and
{\tt (A2,A3,A4)}. The sign is to be $+ 1$ if the triple product
$\overrightarrow{\left(A_{2}A_{1}\right)}\cdot\left[\overrightarrow{\left(A_{2}A_{3}\right)}\times\overrightarrow{\left(A_{2}A_{4}\right)}\right]$
is positive.

\section{Using the basis set library}\label{sec:molbasis}\index{basis
set library}

The use of the basis set library supplied with \siraba\ is indicated
by the word {\tt BASIS} or {\tt ATOMBASIS} on the first line of the
molecular input.

If {\tt BASIS} is used, a common basis set is used for all atoms in
the molecule, and the name of this basis set is given on the second line.
If we want to use one basis set for all the
atoms in a molecule, the molecule input file can be significantly
simplified, as we may delete all the input information regarding the
basis set. Thus, the input in the previous section for tetrahedrane
with the 6-31G** basis will, if the basis set library is used,  be reduced
to:

\begin{verbatim}
 1:BASIS
 2:6-31G**
 3:        Tetrahedrane, Td_symmetric geometry
 4:                 4-31G** basis
 5:    2    2  X  Y  Z   1.00D-15
 6:        6.    2
 7:C1    1.379495419          .0                 0.975450565
 8:C2     .0                 1.379495419         -.975450565
 9:        1.    2
10:H1    3.020386510         .0                  2.1357357837
11:H2     .0                 3.020386510         -2.1357357837
\end{verbatim}

The use of the basis set library is indicated by the presence of the
\verb|BASIS| word in the beginning of \mol-file instead of
\verb|INTGRL|.

An alternative approach would be to use different basis sets for
different atoms, e.g. the concept of locally dense\index{locally dense
basis set} basis sets
introduced in NMR calculations by Chesnut {\it et
al.\/}~\cite{dbcberkdmdaejcc14}. This is for instance also required
when using the ANO\index{ANO basis set} or NQvD\index{NQvD basis set}
basis sets. Another option is to use
standards basis sets from the basis set library\index{basis set
library} and add your own sets
of diffuse, thight or polarizing\index{polarization function} basis
functions. Returning to
tetrahedrane, we could for instance use the 6-31G* basis sets on
carbon and the 4-31G** basis sets on hydrogen. This could be achieved
as

\begin{verbatim}
 1:ATOMBASIS
 2:        Tetrahedrane, Td_symmetric geometry
 3:    Mixed basis (6-31G* on C and 4-31G** on H)
 4:    2    2  X  Y  Z   1.00D-15
 5:        6.    2 6-31G*
 6:C1    1.379495419          .0                 0.975450565
 7:C2     .0                 1.379495419         -.975450565
 8:        1.    2 4-31G Pol 2 0.75D0
 9:H1    3.020386510         .0                  2.1357357837
10:H2     .0                 3.020386510         -2.1357357837
\end{verbatim}


Thus, when using {\tt ATOMBASIS}\index{ATOMBASIS} the name of the
basis set for a given
set of identical atoms is given on the same line as the nuclear
charge, following right after the number of symmetry-distinct atoms of
this type. Everything following position 15 (the number of
symmetry-distinct atoms) is in free format.

The string {\tt Pol} denotes that the rest of the line specifies
diffuse, tight or polarizing\index{polarization function}
functions, all which will be added as segmented basis functions.
For each basis function, its ``angular momentum'' ($l+1$) and its
exponent must be given. Thus, in the above input we indicate that
we add a $p$ function with exponent 0.75 to the hydrogen basis
set. The order of these functions are arbitrary (that is, a $p$
function can be given before an $s$ function and so on).

The ANO basis sets require that you give the number of contracted
functions you would like to use for each of the primitive sets defined
in the basis sets. Thus, assuming we would like to simulate the
6-31G** basis set input using an ANO basis set but with the
polarization functions of the 6-31G** set, this could be achieved
through an input like

\begin{verbatim}
 1:ATOMBASIS
 2:        Tetrahedrane, Td_symmetric geometry
 3:    Mixed basis (6-31G* on C and 4-31G** on H)
 4:    2    2  X  Y  Z   1.00D-15
 5:        6.    2 ano-1 3 2 0 0 Pol 3 0.8
 6:C1    1.379495419          .0                 0.975450565
 7:C2     .0                 1.379495419         -.975450565
 8:        1.    2 ano-1 2 0 0 Pol 2 0.75D0
 9:H1    3.020386510         .0                  2.1357357837
10:H2     .0                 3.020386510         -2.1357357837
\end{verbatim}

This input will give a [3s2p0d0f] ANO basis set\index{ANO basis set}
on carbon, with a
polarizing $d$ function with exponent 0.8, and a [2s0p0d] ANO basis
set on hydrogen with a polarizing $p$ function with exponent 0.75 as
above.

Note that the number of contracted functions in the ANO\index{ANO
basis set} set has to be
given for all primitive blocks, even though you do not want any
contracted functions of a given quantum number. Here also, {\tt Pol}
separates the number of contracted functions from polarization
functions.

The NQvD basis set~\cite{nqvdref} was constructed in order to provide,
in electronic form, a basis set compilation very similar to original
set of van Duijneveldt~\cite{fbvdibmrap}\index{NQvD basis set}. The
sets are in general as
good, or slightly better, than the original van Duijneveldt basis,
with only minor changes in the orbital exponents.

In the NQvD basis set, you need not only to pick the number of
contracted functions, but also your primitive set. The contracted
basis set will be constructed contracting the (NPRIM-NCONT + 1)
tightest functions with contraction coefficients based on the
eigenvectors from the atomic optimization, keeping the outermost
orbitals uncontracted.

NOTE: As is customary, the orbital exponents of all hydrogen basis
functions are automatically multiplied by a factor of 1.44.

Thus, an input for tetrahedrane employing the NQvD basis set might
look like

\begin{verbatim}
 1:ATOMBASIS
 2:        Tetrahedrane, Td_symmetric geometry
 3:    Mixed basis (6-31G* on C and 4-31G** on H)
 4:    2    2  X  Y  Z   1.00D-15
 5:        6.    2 NQvD 8 4 3 2 Pol 3 0.8D0
 6:C1    1.379495419          .0                 0.975450565
 7:C2     .0                 1.379495419         -.975450565
 8:        1.    2 NQvD 4 2 Pol 2 0.75D0
 9:H1    3.020386510         .0                  2.1357357837
10:H2     .0                 3.020386510         -2.1357357837
\end{verbatim}

This input will use an (8s4p/4s) primitive basis set on carbon and
hydrogen respectively, contracting it to a [3s2p/2s] set. The
polarization functions should no further explanation at this
stage. \typeout{Sonia: what does the sentence above mean?????}

The only limitations to the use of polarization functions when {\tt
ATOMBASIS} is used, is that the length of the line must note exceed 80
characters. If that happens, we recommend dumping a standard basis set
to \verb|DALTON.BAS| using the keyword \Key{MOLPRI}, and then adding
functions to this set.

\section{The basis sets supplied with \siraba }

As mentioned above, all the basis sets supplied with this distribution
of the \siraba\ program --- with the exception of the ANO,
sadlej\index{sadlej basis set}\index{ANO basis set}\index{NQvD basis
set} and NQvD basis sets --- have been obtained from the EMSL basis set
library~\cite{emslref}. In a very few cases we have corrected the
files as obtained from this site, but we do not take responsibility
for any errors inherent in these files.

The ANO and sadlej polarization basis sets have been obtained from the
MOLCAS homepage without any further processing, and should therefore
be free of errors. The NQvD has been provided to us by Knut F\ae gri,
and has been slightly reformatted for more convenient processing of
the file, hopefully without having introduced any errors.

%Below we give a a list of all basis set that comes with this
%distribution along with a list of the elements supported, and the
%proper reference to be used when employing a given basis set in a
%calculation. In the basis set directory, we have --- for the
%convienence of the user --- supplied some files only containing basis
%functions. Although not possible to use in the \siraba\ program, they
%may be used when adding polarization functions using the {\tt
%ATOMBASIS} keyword.
