            Pair energy regression parameters                 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 The calculated pair energies were fitted to the function:

 f(x) = a*x^{-6} 

 where x is the pair distance.
 Only pairs in the dispersion range
 (3 Angstrom to pair cutoff distance) were included in the fit

 The x^{-6} term is the leading order term as shown in:
 Hoyvik et al., J. Chem. Phys. 136, 014105 (2012), app. C     

 Lag. scheme : a =     -27.169589     Hartree*bohr^6 =    -0.59660934     Hartree*Angstrom^6
