            Pair energy regression parameters

 The calculated pair energies were fitted to the function:

 f(x) = a*x^{-6} 

 where x is the pair distance.
 Only pairs in the dispersion range
 (3 Angstrom to pair cutoff distance) were included in the fit

 The x^{-6} term is the leading order term as shown in:
