 The isotropically averaged parallel and perpendicular beta values
 are calculated in the following way:

 BetaParallel      = 1/5 * SUM_{i,j} ( beta_{jii} + beta_{iji} + beta_{iij} ) * DipoleUnit(j)
 BetaPerpendicular = 1/5 * SUM_{i,j} ( 2beta_{jii} - 3beta_{iji} + 2beta_{iij} ) * DipoleUnit(j)

 where DipoleUnit is a unit vector in the direction of the permanent dipole moment,
 and the i and j summations run independently over x,y,z.
