 *        SECOND HYPERPOLARIZABILITY TENSOR RESULTS (in a.u.)        *
 *********************************************************************


 The isotropically averaged parallel and perpendicular gamma values
 are calculated in the following way:

 GammaParallel      = 1/15 * SUM_{i,j} ( gamma_{jiij} + gamma_{jiji} + gamma_{jjii} )
 GammaPerpendicular = 1/15 * SUM_{i,j} ( 2*gamma_{jiij} - gamma_{jjii} )

 where the i and j summations run independently over x,y,z.




 Frequency B = .50000E-01 + 0.0000    i
 Frequency C = .50000E-01 + 0.0000    i
 Frequency D = .50000E-01 + 0.0000    i
