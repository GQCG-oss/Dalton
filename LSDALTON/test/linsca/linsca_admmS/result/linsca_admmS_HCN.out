 Configuration:
 ==============
    This is an OpenMP calculation using   4 threads.
    This is a serial calculation (no MPI)
 
     This is a DFT calculation of type: B3LYP

  The Exchange-Correlation Grid specifications:

                      Implies also that the angular integration quality becomes Z-dependant

                      Combined with a blockwise handling of grid points
                      J. Chem. Phys. (2004) vol 121, page 2915.
                      Useful for large molecules.

  We use grid pruning according to Mol. Phys. (1993) vol 78 page 997

with Van Lenthe fixed level shifts      

 Maximum size of Fock/density queue in averaging:           7

Convergence threshold for gradient:   0.10E-03
 
We perform the calculation in the Grand Canonical basis
(see PCCP 2009, 11, 5805-5813)
To use the standard input basis use .NOGCBASIS
 
Since the input basis set is a segmented contracted basis we
perform the integral evaluation in the more efficient
standard input basis and then transform to the Grand 
Canonical basis, which is general contracted.
You can force the integral evaluation in Grand 
Canonical basis by using the keyword
.NOGCINTEGRALTRANSFORM
 
    The Overall Screening threshold is set to              :1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for Coulomb               :1.0000E-10
    The Screening threshold used for Exchange              :1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for One-electron operators:1.0000E-15
 The SCF Convergence Criteria is applied to the gradnorm in AO basis

 A set of atomic calculations are performed in order to construct
 the Grand Canonical Basis set (see PCCP 11, 5805-5813 (2009))
 as well as JCTC 5, 1027 (2009)
 This is done in order to use the TRILEVEL starting guess and 
 perform orbital localization
 This is Level 1 of the TRILEVEL starting guess and is performed per default.
 The use of the Grand Canonical Basis can be deactivated using .NOGCBASIS
 under the **GENERAL section. This is NOT recommended if you do TRILEVEL 
 or orbital localization.
