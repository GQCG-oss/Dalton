 Configuration:
 ==============
    This is a Single core calculation. (no OpenMP)
    This is a serial calculation (no MPI)
 The Functional chosen is a GGA type functional
 The Functional chosen contains a exact exchange contribution
 with the weight:  0.20000000000000001     
   
  The Exchange-Correlation Grid specifications:

                      Implies also that the angular integration quality becomes Z-dependant
  Space partitioning: Becke partitioning scheme with atomic size correction
                      J. Chem. Phys. (1988) vol 88 page 2547
                      Combined with a blockwise handling of grid points
                      J. Chem. Phys. (2004) vol 121, page 2915.
                      Useful for large molecules.

   You have requested Augmented Roothaan-Hall optimization
   => explicit averaging is turned off!

Expand trust radius if ratio is larger than:            0.75
Contract trust radius if ratio is smaller than:         0.25
On expansion, trust radius is expanded by a factor      1.20
On contraction, trust radius is contracted by a factor  0.70

 Maximum size of subspace in ARH linear equations:           2

Density subspace min. method    : None                    
Density optimization : Augmented RH optimization          

 Maximum size of Fock/density queue in averaging:           7

Convergence threshold for gradient:   0.10E-03
 
We perform the calculation in the Grand Canonical basis
(see PCCP 2009, 11, 5805-5813)
To use the standard input basis use .NOGCBASIS
 
Since the input basis set is a segmented contracted basis we
perform the integral evaluation in the more efficient
standard input basis and then transform to the Grand 
Canonical basis, which is general contracted.
You can force the integral evaluation in Grand 
Canonical basis by using the keyword
.NOGCINTEGRALTRANSFORM
 
    The Overall Screening threshold is set to              :  1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for Coulomb               :  1.0000E-10
    The Screening threshold used for Exchange              :  1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for One-electron operators:  1.0000E-15
 The SCF Convergence Criteria is applied to the gradnorm in OAO basis

Matrix type: mtype_dense
 
 A set of atomic calculations are performed in order to construct
 the Grand Canonical Basis set (see PCCP 11, 5805-5813 (2009))
 as well as JCTC 5, 1027 (2009)
 This is done in order to use the TRILEVEL starting guess and 
 perform orbital localization
 This is Level 1 of the TRILEVEL starting guess and is performed per default.
 The use of the Grand Canonical Basis can be deactivated using .NOGCBASIS
 under the **GENERAL section. This is NOT recommended if you do TRILEVEL 
 or orbital localization.
