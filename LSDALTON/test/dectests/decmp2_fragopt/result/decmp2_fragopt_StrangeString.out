 Configuration:
 ==============
    This is a Single core calculation. (no OpenMP)
    This is a serial calculation (no MPI)

   You have requested Augmented Roothaan-Hall optimization
   => explicit averaging is turned off!

Expand trust radius if ratio is larger than:            0.75
Contract trust radius if ratio is smaller than:         0.25
On expansion, trust radius is expanded by a factor      1.20
On contraction, trust radius is contracted by a factor  0.70

 Maximum size of subspace in ARH linear equations:           2

Density subspace min. method    : None                    
Density optimization : Augmented RH optimization          

 Maximum size of Fock/density queue in averaging:          10

Convergence threshold for gradient:   0.10E-03
 
We perform the calculation in the Grand Canonical basis
(see PCCP 2009, 11, 5805-5813)
To use the standard input basis use .NOGCBASIS
 
Due to the presence of the keyword (default for correlation)
.NOGCINTEGRALTRANSFORM
We transform the input basis to the Grand Canonical
basis and perform integral evaluation using this basis
 
    The Overall Screening threshold is set to              :  1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for Coulomb               :  1.0000E-10
    The Screening threshold used for Exchange              :  1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for One-electron operators:  1.0000E-15
 The SCF Convergence Criteria is applied to the gradnorm in OAO basis

     ** ORBITAL LOCALIZATION INFORMATION **
  Orbital localization using canonical molecular orbitals as starting guess 
  is requested. For more efficient orbital localization (particularly for large) 
  system, use options  .START/TRILEVEL and .LCM in *DENSOPT section.   

 Warning **DEC and **CC enforces the use of the .LCM keyword

 End of configuration!

 >>>  CPU Time used in *INPUT is   0.00 seconds
 >>> wall Time used in *INPUT is   0.00 seconds
 
Matrix type: mtype_dense
 
 A set of atomic calculations are performed in order to construct
 the Grand Canonical Basis set (see PCCP 11, 5805-5813 (2009))
 as well as JCTC 5, 1027 (2009)
 This is done in order to use the TRILEVEL starting guess and 
 perform orbital localization
 This is Level 1 of the TRILEVEL starting guess and is performed per default.
 The use of the Grand Canonical Basis can be deactivated using .NOGCBASIS
 under the **GENERAL section. This is NOT recommended if you do TRILEVEL 
 or orbital localization.

  Allocated MPI memory a cross all slaves:          0 byte  - Should be zero - otherwise a leakage is present
  This is a non MPI calculation so naturally no memory is allocated on slaves!
