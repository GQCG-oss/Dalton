 Configuration:
 ==============
    This is an OpenMP calculation using   2 threads.
    This is a serial calculation (no MPI)

Density subspace min. method    : Van Lenthe modified DIIS
Density optimization : Diagonalization                    
with Van Lenthe fixed level shifts      

 Maximum size of Fock/density queue in averaging:          10

Convergence threshold for gradient:   0.10E-05
We perform the calculation in the standard input basis
 
    The Overall Screening threshold is set to              :  1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for Coulomb               :  1.0000E-10
    The Screening threshold used for Exchange              :  1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for One-electron operators:  1.0000E-15
 The SCF Convergence Criteria is applied to the gradnorm in AO basis
