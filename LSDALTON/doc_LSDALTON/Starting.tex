\chapter{Getting started with {\lsdalton}}\label{ch:starting}

In this chapter we give an introduction to the two input files needed
for doing a calculation with the {\lsdalton} program
(MOLECULE.INP and LSDALTON.INP), as well as the
shell script file that is supplied with the program for moving
relevant files to the scratch-directory and back to the home directory
after a calculation has completed. A couple of examples of
input files  are also provided. Finally, the different output files
generated by the program are discussed.

\section{The \mol\ input file}

Basically, the \mol\ file contains the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Cartesian coodinates for all atoms
\item The basis set(s) to be used
\end{itemize}

Please note the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Supplying the molecular geometry in the form of a Z-matrix 
is not supported
by \lsdalton\, since this format is ill suited for large scale 
calculations.
\item Molecular symmetry is not exploited by \lsdalton\, since
the target systems of the program are large biomolecules, which
hardly ever contains any symmetry. 
\end{itemize}

There are two different types of molecule file, using either BASIS or ATOMBASIS.
ATOMBASIS is relevant only if different basis sets on individual atoms are required.
In the following, we describe these two types of \mol\ files using simple examples.

\subsection{BASIS}
A BASIS \mol\ file may look like this:
\begin{verbatim}
1     BASIS
2     cc-pVDZ Aux=Ahlrichs-Coulomb-Fit
3     water R(OH) = 0.95Aa , <HOH = 109 deg.
4     Distance in Aangstroms
5     Atomtypes=2 Angstrom
6     Charge=8.0 Atoms=1
7     O      0.00000   0.00000   0.00000
8     Charge=1.0 Atoms=2
9     H      0.55168   0.77340   0.00000
10    H      0.55168  -0.77340   0.00000
\end{verbatim} 

We now describe the \mol\ file line by line:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line 1: The word "BASIS", indicating that the same basis set should be used for all 
atoms.
\item Line 2: The name of the basis set, in this case cc-pVDZ. Optional: The name
of the auxiliary basis set, in this case Ahlrichs-Coulomb-Fit
(only referenced if density-fitting is requested in LSDALTON.INP)
\item Lines 3-4: Comments (may be left blank)
\item Line 5: {\bf Atomtypes=} Number of different atoms - in the case of H$_2$O, there are two different
atoms type, H and O. {\bf Angstrom} If this keyword is omitted, the program will assume that coordinates
are given in atomic units (Bohr). Other options in this line are:
{\bf Charge=} Molecular charge - assumed to be zero if omitted. 
{\bf Nosymmetry} This have no effect as no pointgroup symmetry have been implemented. 
\item Lines 6 and 8: A line of this type has to come before the Cartesian coordinates of each atom
type, indicating a) The nuclear charge of the atom type, and b) The number of atoms of this type.
\item Lines 7, 9-10: Cartesian coordinates of the atoms (in Angstrom, since this was specified 
in line 5).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ATOMBASIS}

An ATOMBASIS \mol\ file may look like this:
\begin{verbatim}
ATOMBASIS
water R(OH) = 0.95Aa , <HOH = 109 deg.
Distance in Aangstroms
Atomtypes=2 Angstrom
Charge=8.0 Atoms=1 Basis=cc-pVDZ Aux=Ahlrichs-Coulomb-Fit
O      0.00000   0.00000   0.00000
Charge=1.0 Atoms=2 Basis=cc-pVDZ Aux=Ahlrichs-Coulomb-Fit
H      0.55168   0.77340   0.00000
H      0.55168  -0.77340   0.00000
\end{verbatim}
As seen from the example, there is little difference between the two
formats. Line 2 in the BASIS file has been removed, and instead the basis
sets (and optionally, the auxiliary basis sets) are now given for each
atom. In this example they are the same, as it would probably not make
much sense to use different basis sets for the atoms in water. This can
make sense, though, for larger molecules. An example could be a biomocule containing
an active site with one or more transition metal atoms. In may be useful to
describe such an active site at a higher level of theory than the surroundings. 

\subsection{User defined basis sets}

The user may supply his or her own basis set in two ways. Both ways require that the MOLECULE.INP file is argumented with a basis as in the following two examples

\begin{verbatim}
1     BASIS
2     USERDEFINED
3     water R(OH) = 0.95Aa , <HOH = 109 deg.

7     O      0.00000   0.00000   0.00000
8     Charge=1.0 Atoms=2
9     H      0.55168   0.77340   0.00000
10    H      0.55168  -0.77340   0.00000

Line 13 to 24 contain the Basis set information for the Hydrogen atom. 
Line 13 denote the nuclear charge. Line 14 through 16 are comments. Line 17 states 
that there are 4 primitive functions and 2 contracted functions.
Line 18 to 21 contain information about the primitive functions. The first number is the exponent 
and the next 2 numbers are the coefficients for the 2 contracted functions.
Line 22-24 contain info about p orbitals on hydrogen, while Line 25-47 contain similar information 
about oxygen.

Alternative the userdefined basis may be used in connection with the ATOMBASIS
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Finally the basis set files from the Basis Set exchange (EMSL) 
https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal may be downloaded and put into 
the basis set directory and used directly. The name specified by 
the input should match the name of the file in the basis set directory
(see testcase linsca/linsca_emsl for an example).

\section{The LSDALTON.INP file}\label{sec:daltoninp}
In this section, we show two typical examples of a LSDALTON.INP file, one
for small molecules and one for large molecules. Many other examples
of input files for requesting e.g. specific molecular properties may be found
at \verb|http://daltonprogram.org|, and
a complete reference manual of all keywords is found in Chapter \ref{ch:keywords}.

In general, the LSDALTON.INP is divided in four different sections under
the headlines:
\begin{itemize}
\item **INTEGRAL contain settings for the calculation of integrals (optional)
\item **WAVE FUNCTIONS contains info about the wave function (e.g. HF/DFT) and settings
for optimization of the wave function (mandatory)
\item **OPTIMIZE contains settings for geometry optimization (optional). If this keyword
      is present in the input a full geometry optimization will be performed, otherwise a single-point 
      calculation is carried out.
\item **RESPONS contains info about requested properties (optional)
\end{itemize}
Each of these sections may contain subsections, indicated by a single asterisk.
The LSDALTON.INP file should always end with \verb|*END OF INPUT|. 

A typical example of LSDALTON.INP for a {\bf small molecule} (say, less than 100 atoms) could look like:
\begin{verbatim}
**INTEGRAL
.NOJENGINE
.NOLINK
**WAVE FUNCTIONS
.HF
*DENSOPT
.RH
.DIIS
.CONVTHR
1.0D-6
**RESPONS
.NEXCIT
5
*END OF INPUT
\end{verbatim}
Here, we have requested a Hartree-Fock optimization under **WAVE FUNCTION. The subsection
*DENSOPT contains setting for how the density should be optimized. The .RH (.i.e. Roothaan-Hall)
and .DIIS keywords requests a standard diagonalization combined with the DIIS scheme for convergence
acceleration. With the keyword .CONVTHR (i.e. convergence threshold) 
it is requested that iterations are terminated when the 
Frobenius norm of the SCF gradient is smaller than 10$^{-6}$. Finally, we have under **RESPONS requested
the calculation of the five lowest excitation energies with .NEXCIT (i.e. number of excitation energies).
Note that under **INTEGRAL we have turned off the LinK and J-engine schemes for speeding up the calculation
of the exact exchange and Coulomb contributions, respectively, since these are probably not needed for a small
molecule.

A typical example of LSDALTON.INP for a {\bf large molecule} (say, more than 100 atoms) could look like: 
\begin{verbatim}
**INTEGRAL
.DENSFIT
**WAVE FUNCTIONS
.DFT
 BP86
*DENSOPT
.START
 TRILEVEL
.ARH
.CONVDYN
 STANDARD
*END OF INPUT
\end{verbatim}
Under **INTEGRAL, we have requested the use of density-fitting to speed up the calculation (the use of J-engine is default). 
Under **WAVE FUNCTIONS, we now request a DFT
calculation using the BP86 exchange-correlation functional.

Since this is a calculation on a large molecule, 
we request the trilevel starting guess (atomic, valence, and then full
optimization) and the Augmented Rothaan-Hall (ARH) method for density optimization. 
Note that ARH is default, so this keyword is actually unnecessary.
ARH is more robust than the standard diagonalization/DIIS scheme, and linear-scaling if sparse-matrix algebra is employed. You may use
sparse-matrix algebra by putting .CSR (i.e. Compressed-Sparse Row) under *DENSOPT (NB: requires linking to the MKL library).
