This is the manual for the \lsdalton\ quantum chemistry program
--- Release Dalton2011 --- for computing Hartree-Fock and DFT 
wave functions, energies, and molecular properties.
The focus of \lsdalton\ is on {\em linear scaling} in all parts 
of the code, which makes it suitable for calculations on large
molecular systems.

We emphasize the conditions under which the
program is distributed.  It is furnished for your own use,
and you may not redistribute it further, neither in whole nor in
part.  Even though \lsdalton\ is completely separate from the original
\dalton\ program, the program packages are distributed together in the
Dalton2011 suite. Thus, 
anyone interested in obtaining \lsdalton\ should check out the
\dalton\ homepage at
\verb|http://daltonprogram.org|.

Any use of the program that results in published
material should cite two papers which are expected to be out in the spring
of 2011. At that point, the references will be put both here and in the DALTON.OUT
output file from an \lsdalton\ calculation.
%Any use of the program that results in published

%``Energy paper?'' \\
%``Response paper?''
%\end{quote}

The program represents experimental code that is
under constant development.  No guarantees of any kind are
provided, and the authors accept no responsibility for the
performance of the code or for the correctness of the results.
