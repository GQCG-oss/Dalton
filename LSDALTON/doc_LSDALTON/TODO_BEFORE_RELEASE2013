Things to do before release 2013
********************************

* Everybody please feel free to add/remove things from this list!

- cleanup keywords and update manual
- Write "New features" section for manual and homepage
- Remove non-releasable code (see below)
- Remove the old TrSCF .DSM ? ? ? 
- cleanup test cases
- run lots of test calculations for different various LSDALTON:
      	   serial, massively parallel, large molecules
- Response properties in LSDalton - wrappers for (magnetic) properties not present in 2011 version
- Clean up Output file (For the users point of view on the requested output should be there, but print of Timings can be added, print of HOMO-LUMO gap can be added and so on.)  
- Document tools directory (KK: Integrated gridgen into lsdalton.x, also did some cleanup)
- Make **GENERAL section with general info. Currently *DENSOPT has become a junk box with various inputs.
- update author list
- Treat $INFO in the same way as other input sections (call it **INFO). Currently $INFO only works if it is put in the *DENSOPT section, which is mostly an historical artefact.
- Rename DALTON.INP to LSDALTON.INP (TK).


Non-releasable code
*******************

If you don't want to release some part of the code write we will use a "MOD_UNRELEASED" flag, 
e.g., if you want subroutines A and C to be a part of the release 2013 version but not subroutine B:

subroutine A
...
end subroutine A

#ifdef MOD_UNRELEASED
subroutine B
...
end subroutine B
#endif

subroutine C
....
end subroutine C


Then when building LSDALTON with cmake using the --release flag, the code from 
"#ifdef MOD_UNRELEASED" to "#endif" will not be compiled and effectively the code is:


subroutine A
...
end subroutine A

subroutine C
....
end subroutine C


For the actual release all code encapsulated by "#ifdef MOD_UNRELEASED" to "#endif" will be removed by a script. Thus, that code will never be seen by any users.

Naturally LSDALTON should compile both with and without --release!!!
