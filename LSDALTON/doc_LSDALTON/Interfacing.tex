\chapter{Interfacing to {\lsdalton}}\label{interfacing}

In this chapter we give an introduction to the normalization, basis set and ordering of atomic orbitals used in the {\lsdalton} program. 

This is provided in case you want to interface to the {\lsdalton} program or want to read one of the files written by the {\lsdalton} program, for instance 
the local orbitals.
Certain functionality can also be incorporated into other programs by linking to the
{\lsdalton}-library bundle, as outlined in section~\ref{sec:LSlib}.

\section{The Grand Canonical Basis}

Unlike all other Quantum Chemistry Programs the {\lsdalton} program, uses the so called grand canonical basis \cite{trilevel1,trilevel2} as the internal default basis. 
The results therefore cannot directly be compared to other programs unless the 
\begin{verbatim}
.NOGCBASIS
\end{verbatim}
keyword is specified. This keyword deactivates the use of the grand canonical basis and uses the input basis instead. 
An exception is Dunning's correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, ..., aug-cc-pVDZ, etc.) for which the .NOGCBASIS keyword is used by default.

\section{Basisset and Ordering}

In {\lsdalton} the default basis set are real-valued spherical harmonic Gaussian type
orbitals (GTOs)
\begin{equation}
G_{ilm}(\textbf{r}; a_{i};\textbf{A}) = S_{lm}(x_{A}; y_{A}; z_{A}) \exp(-a_{i}r^{2}_{A})
\end{equation}
where $S_{lm}(x_{A}; y_{A}; z_{A})$ is a real solid harmonic introduced in section 6.4.2 of Ref.~\cite{MEST} (see Table 6.3).
Concerning the ordering of basis functions, it is one atomtype after the other as given
in the input, and for each atomtype, it is one atom after another as given in input. For
each atom increasing with angular momentum $l$, within one angular momentum $l$, the ordering 
is first the components (e.g. $p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}$), and then the contracted functions.



So for an atom consisting of 3 s functions 2 p functions and 1 d function, the ordering is
$\{1s; 2s; 3s; 1p_{x};1p_{y};1p_{z}; 2p_{x};2p_{y};2p_{z}; 1d_{xy}; 1d_{yz}; 1d_{z2-r2} ; 1d_{xz}; 1d_{x2-y2}\}$
In {\lsdalton} the ordering of the basis functions are $m = \{-l,\cdots,0,\cdots,l\}$ for a given
angular momentum $l$. Although for computational efficiency the p orbitals are treated as a
special case with $p = \{ p_{x},p_{y},p_{z} \}$ which corresponds to $m = \{1,-1,0 \}$.

\section{Normalization}

For an unnormalized primitive spherical harmonic GTO, the overlap is given by
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \chi^{\eqtext{GTO}}_{i lm} | \chi^{\eqtext{GTO}}_{i lm} \right\rangle = (N_i^{\eqtext{p}})^2 \left(\frac{\pi}{2a_i}\right)^{3/2}\frac{1}{(4a_i)^l}
\end{equation}
(where the last term corresponds to $1/(2p)^l$ according to for example Eq. 9.3.8 of Ref. \cite{MEST}. This gives 
the primitive normalization factor $N^{\eqtext{p}}$
\begin{equation}
  N^{\eqtext{p}}_i = \frac{(4a_i)^{l/2+3/4}}{\pi^{3/4}}
\end{equation}
Naturally the default in {\lsdalton} is not primitive GTOs but contracted GTOs written as linear combinations of primitive spherical-harmonic GTOs of different exponents
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu lm}(\textbf{r}; a;\textbf{A}) = \sum_{i} G_{ilm}(\textbf{r}; a_{i};\textbf{A})d^{\eqtext{norm}}_{i\mu}
\end{equation}
in {\lsdalton} we determine $d^{\eqtext{norm}}_{i\mu}$ as
\begin{equation}
d^{\eqtext{norm}}_{i\mu} = N^{\eqtext{p}}_{i}N^{\eqtext{c}}_{i\mu}d^{\eqtext{basis}}_{i\mu}
\end{equation}
As explained, $N^{\eqtext{p}}_{i}$ is the normalization of the primitive GTOs, $d^{\eqtext{basis}}_{i\mu}$ are the 
unmodified contraction coefficients read from the basis set file. $N^{\eqtext{c}}_{i}$ is the normalization of the contracted functions and is determined using the overlap between two normalized primitive GTOs of the same angular momentum, but different exponents
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle \chi^{\eqtext{GTO}}_{a_{i}lm} | \chi^{\eqtext{GTO}}_{a_{j}lm} \right\rangle = \biggl( \frac{\sqrt{ 4 a_{i} a_{j}}}{a_{i}+a_{j}} \biggr)^{\frac{3}{2}+l}
\end{eqnarray}
so that the contraction coefficients for the contracted function $N^{\eqtext{c}}_{i}$ are found by first finding the overlap
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{S}_{\mu} = \sum_{ij} d_{i\mu}^{\eqtext{basis}} d_{j\mu}^{\eqtext{basis}} \left\langle \chi^{\eqtext{GTO}}_{ilm} | \chi^{\eqtext{GTO}}_{jlm} \right\rangle = \sum_{ij} d_{i\mu}^{\eqtext{basis}} d_{j\mu}^{\eqtext{basis}} \biggl( \frac{\sqrt{ 4 a_{i} a_{j}}}{a_{i}+a_{j}} \biggr)^{\frac{3}{2}+l}
\end{eqnarray}
where $d_{i\mu}^{\eqtext{basis}}$ are the unmodified coefficients and then construct the coefficients
\begin{eqnarray}
d_{i\mu}^{\eqtext{norm}} &=& N^{\eqtext{p}}_{i}N^{\eqtext{c}}_{i\mu}d^{\eqtext{basis}}_{i\mu} = N^{\eqtext{p}}_{i}\frac{d^{\eqtext{basis}}_{i\mu}}{\sqrt{ \mathcal{S}_{\mu} }} = \frac{d_{i\mu}^{\eqtext{basis}}}{\sqrt{\mathcal{S}_{\mu}}} \biggl( 4 a_{i}\biggr)^{\frac{l}{2} + \frac{3}{4}} \biggl( \frac{1}{\pi} \biggr)^{\frac{3}{4}}\end{eqnarray}

\section{Matrix File Format}

During an {\lsdalton} calculation a number of files may be generated. This list of files include 

\begin{verbatim}
dens.restart - The density matrix
fock.restart - The fock matrix
overlapmatrix - The overlap matrix
cmo_orbitals.u - The canonical Molecular orbitals 
lcm_orbitals.u - The local Molecular orbitals 
\end{verbatim}

the files are all written using the Fortran 90 code

\begin{lstlisting}
OPEN(UNIT=IUNIT,FILE='dens.restart',STATUS='UNKNOWN',FORM='UNFORMATTED',IOSTAT=IOS)
WRITE(iunit) A%Nrow, A%Ncol
WRITE(iunit)(A%elms(I),I=1,A%nrow*A%ncol)
CLOSE(UNIT=IUNIT,,STATUS='KEEP')
\end{lstlisting}

Where A is a derived type containing the number of rows (A$\%$nrow), the number of columns (A$\%$ncol), and the elements stored in a vector array (A$\%$elms). 

The dens.restart is different as it contains an additional logical 
\begin{lstlisting}
OPEN(UNIT=IUNIT,FILE='dens.restart',STATUS='UNKNOWN',FORM='UNFORMATTED',IOSTAT=IOS)
WRITE(iunit) A%Nrow, A%Ncol
WRITE(iunit)(A%elms(I),I=1,A%nrow*A%ncol)
WRITE(iunit) GCBASIS
CLOSE(UNIT=IUNIT,,STATUS='KEEP')
\end{lstlisting}
{\sc important:} When interfacing to other programs, the logical GCBASIS should always be false, 
i.e. by specifying the keyword
\begin{verbatim}
.NOGCBASIS
\end{verbatim}
in the LSDALTON.INP.
If the logical GCBASIS is true 
the dens.restart is given in terms of the grand canonical basis rather than the input basis.


\section{The {\lsdalton} library bundle}
\label{sec:LSlib}

The {\lsdalton} library bundle \verb|liblsdalton.a| allows for porting \lsdalton\ code 
functionality to other programs. Currently this functionalty is limited to 
the evaluation of certain standard AO integrals and integral components: the overlap 
matrix, the one-electron integral matrix (combining kinetic energy and 
nuclear-electron attraction contributions), the Coulomb, exchange and exchange-correlation 
matrices and the four-center two-electron repulsion integrals. Also, the 
first derivatives of these integral components with respect to the nuclear displacments 
are available, see the file \verb|LSDALTON/lsdaltonsrc/LSlib_tester.F90|
for details. 

After building \lsdalton\ under a \verb|build| directory (consult the installation guide
\verb|http://daltonprogram.org/installation/2013/| for assistance), the \lsdalton\ library 
\verb|liblsdalton.a| can be found under \verb|build\lib|. The you can now link you 
program to the \lsdalton\ library. 
The use is perhaps best illustrated by a simple example. The file \verb|lslib_test.F90|

\begin{verbatim}
PROGRAM testlslib
implicit none
integer :: nbast,natoms,nelectrons,lupri,luerr
integer :: i,j
double precision, allocatable :: Smat(:,:)

call lsinit_all()

lupri = 6 !standard output
luerr = 0 !standard error
CALL LSlib_get_dimensions(nbast,natoms,nelectrons,lupri,luerr)
allocate(Smat(nbast,nbast))
CALL LSlib_get_overlap(Smat,nbast,lupri,luerr)

deallocate(Smat)
call lsfree_all()

END PROGRAM testlslib
\end{verbatim}
%
calculates the AO overlap matrix (\verb|Smat|). To compile \verb|lslib_test.F90|
you have to link to the external libraries required by \lsdalton, typically lapack
and blas. For an example intel/mkl build

\begin{verbatim}
./setup --fc=ifort --cc=icc --cxx=icpc --mkl=parallel --omp
\end{verbatim}
%
you can build the excecutable \verb|lslib_test.x| from \verb|lslib_test.F90| according to

\begin{verbatim}
ifort -mkl=parallel -openmp -parallel -O3 lslib_test.F90 -o lslib_test.x 
/dalton-path/build/lib/liblsdalton.a
\end{verbatim}
%
Exaclty how to compile and link your code to \verb|libsldalton.a| for other types of build 
varies, and it can then be instrutive to see how \lsdalton\ is buildt. To see how 
\verb|lsdalton.x| if compiled and linked, you can type

\begin{verbatim}
make VERBOSE=1 lsdalton.x
\end{verbatim}
%
in the \verb|build| directory. The actual build of \verb|lsdalton.x| can be found towards
the end of the standard output. 

The execution of \verb|lslib_test.x| requires the precense of  valid \molecule\ and \lsdalton\ input 
files in the directory where you execute your program, for example the \verb|MOLECULE.INP|

\begin{verbatim}
BASIS

Atomtypes=2 
Charge=8.0 Atoms=1
O    0.00000 0.00000 0.00000

H    0.00000 0.50000 0.00000
H    0.00000 0.00000 0.50000
\end{verbatim}
%
and the \verb|LSDALTON.INP|

\begin{verbatim}
