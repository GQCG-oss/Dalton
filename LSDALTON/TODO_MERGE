Changes in setup
================

  Basic options:
    --auto            this flag will disappear in new version of setup
    --cpp=STRING      will be renamed to --cxx
    --math-dir=PATH   this will be a bit different in new version
    --internal-math   this will be a bit different in new version
    --mpi32           this does not belong here, cmake should figure out whether mpi lib is 32/64
                      (i have code for it in DIRAC)
    --release         does not belong here, what are users supposed to do with this flag

  Change default paths:
    --scratch=PATH    does not belong here (this is independent of compilation)
    --build=PATH      this works a bit differently in new setup
    --basis=PATH      does not belong here (this is independent of compilation)
    --install=PATH    will be renamed to prefix

  Advanced options:
    --math=STRING     this will be a bit different in new version
    --openrsp         
    --xcfun           
    --interest=PATH   
    --scalasca
