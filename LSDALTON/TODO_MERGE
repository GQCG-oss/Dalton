Changes in setup
================

  Basic options:
    --auto            this flag will disappear in new version of setup
    --fc=STRING       ok
    --mpiexec=STRING  in which situation do you need this flag?
    --cc=STRING       ok
    --cpp=STRING      will be renamed to --cxx
    --math-dir=PATH   this will be a bit different in new version
    --internal-math   this will be a bit different in new version
    --craywrap        ok i can see this
    --mpi             ok
    --mpi32           this does not belong here, cmake should figure out whether mpi lib is 32/64
                      (i have code for it in DIRAC)
    --omp             ok
    --release         does not belong here, what are users supposed to do with this flag
    --mklflag         does not belong here, should be set by math detection
    --lseek           does not belong here
    --int64           ok
    --csr             ok
    --scalapack       ok
    --timings         perhaps move to advanced?
    --show            ok

  Change default paths:
    --scratch=PATH    does not belong here (this is independent of compilation)
    --build=PATH      this works a bit differently in new setup
    --basis=PATH      does not belong here (this is independent of compilation)
    --install=PATH    will be renamed to prefix

    --math=STRING     this will be a bit different in new version
    --debug           ok
    --profile         ok
    --check           ok
    --coverage        ok
    -D STRING         ok
    --openrsp         does not belong to setup IMO (code specific)
    --xcfun           does not belong to setup IMO (code specific)
    --interest=PATH   does not belong to setup IMO (code specific)
