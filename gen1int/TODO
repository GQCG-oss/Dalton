!! Give future long- and short-term developments

Short-term:
1) cleans up the interface module gen1int_interface.F90 to provide both
   Fortran 77 and 90 interafces
2) adds functionality of Cartesian/spherical multipole moment integrals;
   parallelizes gen1int_shell.F90
3) tests the calculations of expectation values; why calling PR1IN1
   with expectation values returned gives wrong results
4) changes the interface so that users could pass information of basis sets
   as arguments
5) enables London atomic orbitals (indicating by logical variable \var(is_lao))
6) implement more property integrals
7) uses header files in Gen1Int library

Long-term:
1) adds functionality of reading/writing integrals and/or expectation values on file
2) considers molecular symmetry
3) works together with other modules, such as geometry optimization and response calculations
