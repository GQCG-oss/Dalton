!! Give future long- and short-term developments

Short-term:
1) adds calculations of expectation values
2) adds functionality of reading/writing integrals and/or expectation values on file
3) make the test suite more automatically, a much better and friendly test suite,
   not eye checking
4) implement more property integrals
5) considers molecular symmetry

Long-term:
1) works together with other modules, such as geometry optimization and response calculations
