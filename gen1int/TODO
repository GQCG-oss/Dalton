!! Give future long- and short-term developments

Short-term:
1) tests the calculations of expectation values
2) adds functionality of reading/writing integrals and/or expectation values on file
3) test suite: why calling PR1IN1 with expectation values returned gives wrong results
4) enables London atomic orbitals (indicating by logical variable \var(is_lao))
5) implement more property integrals
6) considers molecular symmetry

Long-term:
1) works together with other modules, such as geometry optimization and response calculations
