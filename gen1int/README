1. A brief description of the project

   Gen1Int is a Fortran 90 library (with Python interface) to evaluate the
   derivatives of one-electron integrals with respect to the geometry perturbation,
   external electric and magnetic fields, and total rotational angular momentum
   at zero fields with contracted rotational London atomic orbitals (LAO).

2. Notes on the developer's build environment and potential portability problems

   In order to implement Gen1Int into Dalton, we have modified the following files:

   * configure
     tries to find Gen1Int library libgen1int.a and sets the corresponding compiler
     flag (-DBUILD_GEN1INT) if found Gen1Int library
   * Makefile
     adds Gen1Int module
   * setup
     tries to find Gen1Int library libgen1int.a and enables Gen1Int interface
   * CMakeLists.txt
     tries to find Gen1Int library libgen1int.a, and sets the corresponding compiler 
     flag (-DBUILD_GEN1INT) and adds the source codes of Gen1Int interface if found
     Gen1Int library
   * abacus/dalton.F (please search BUILD_GEN1INT)
     calls \fn(gen1int_ifc_clean) to clean up memory etc. for Gen1Int interface
   * abacus/herdrv.F (please search BUILD_GEN1INT)
     calls \fn(gen1int_ifc_test) to perform test suite of Gen1Int interface
   * abacus/herrdn.F (please search BUILD_GEN1INT)
     some modifications for processing different ECPs, and calling \fn(gen1int_ifc_init)
     to intialize Gen1Int interface
   * abacus/her1car.F (please search BUILD_GEN1INT)
     removes the interface of calling old ECP subroutine
   * abacus/her1drv.F (please search BUILD_GEN1INT)
     calls \fn(gen1int_ifc_main) to calculate property integrals
   * include/cbiher.h
     adds logical variable \var(TEST_GEN1INT) to perform test suite of Gen1Int interface

   and added the following files:
   * gen1int directory
     source codes of Gen1Int interface, README, installation instruction, Makefile,
     and test sutie

3. Important files in Gen1Int interface

   * Makefile              : Makefile for Dalton
   * gen1int_ifc_clean.F90 : cleans up the data used in Gen1Int interface after
                             all calculations
   * gen1int_ifc_init.F90  : initializes the data used in Gen1Int interface before
                             any calculation
   * gen1int_ifc_test.F90  : test suite of Gen1Int interface
   * gen1int_ifc_main.F90  : main driver of calling Gen1Int interface from Dalton,
                             loops over different total geometric derivatives, and
                             calls gen1int_ifc_prop() to perform calculations
   * gen1int_ifc_prop.F90  : calculates property integrals and/or expectation values,
                             loops all necessary AO sub-shells, the contracted integrals
                             between two AO sub-shells are then calculated through
                             the subroutines in module gen1int_shell
   * gen1int_shell.F90     : defines the AO sub-shells used in Gen1Int interface and
                             corresponding subroutines
   * gen1int_prop_attr.F90 : returns the number of operators (including different derivatives)
                             and total geometric derivatives, kind of integral matrices according
                             to given property name and the information of total geometric
                             derivatives; this file should be consistent with subroutine
                             \fn(gen1int_shell_prop) in gen1int_shell.F90!!
   * err_thrsh.h           : threshold of error for test suite
   * stdout.h              : IO unit of standard output
   * xkind.h               : kind type parameter of real numbers

   When you use this Gen1Int interface, please be aware that (see gen1int_ifc_main.F90):
     * \var(val_ints) contains the upper and diagonal parts if using triangular format;
     * \var(val_expt) should be zero before calculations

   The parallelization may be implemented in gen1int_ifc_main.F90 and/or gen1int_ifc_prop.F90,
   which correspond to total geometric derivatives and AO sub-shells, respectively.
