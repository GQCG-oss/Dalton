First, please download Gen1Int library from one of the following sites:

   http://repo.ctcc.no/projects/gen1int
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/gen1int

and extract the tar ball.

You may need to update your file database, so that the "configure" in Dalton
may find the Gen1Int library (using `locate` command).

(1) For those using "configure", please answer "y" when you are asked:

    Do you want to activate Gen1Int package in DALTON?

(2) For those using CMake, please provide the path of Gen1Int library like:

    ./setup --lib-gen1int=PATH_OF_GEN1INT

Then make ..., hope everything is OK; otherwise, please write to Bin Gao at
bin.gao@uit.no.

Afterwards, we may suggest you to run the test suite in Gen1Int lirbary and
its interface in Dalton, make sure there is no errors, otherwise, please
also write to Bin Gao with detailed error message.
