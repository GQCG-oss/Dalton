First, please download Gen1Int from one of the following sites:

   http://repo.ctcc.no/projects/gen1int
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/gen1int

and compile the library following its README and INSTALL.

You may need to update your file database, so that the "configure" in Dalton
may find the Gen1Int library (using `locate` command).

(1) For those using "configure", please answer "y" when you are asked:

    Do you want to activate Gen1Int package in DALTON?

(2) For those using CMake, please provide the path of Gen1Int like:

    ./setup --gen1int-dir=PATH_OF_GEN1INT

Then make ..., hope everything is OK; otherwise, please write to Bin Gao at
bin.gao@uit.no.

Afterwards, we may suggest you to run the test suite in "gen1int" directory,
make sure there is no errors, otherwise, please also write to Bin Gao with
detailed error message.
