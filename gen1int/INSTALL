1. Installation

Gen1Int is installed automatically along with
the Dalton source code using the Dalton installation
mechanism. You do not need to download and install
Gen1Int separately.

In case of problems, please write to Bin Gao at
bin.gao@uit.no.

2. Test suite

Afterwards, you may need to run the test suite in Gen1Int library (you need
to compile Gen1Int library and its test suite by yourself if you do not use
git submodule) and the test of Gen1Int interface at Dalton/Dirac (those
test/gen1int_*), make sure there is no error. Otherwise, please write to
Bin Gao with detailed error message.
