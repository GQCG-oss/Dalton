First, please download Gen1Int library from one of the following sites:

   http://repo.ctcc.no/projects/gen1int
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/gen1int

and extract the tar ball.

Then run Dalton setup by providing the path of Gen1Int library:

    ./setup --gen1int-dir PATH_OF_GEN1INT

and make. Hope everything is OK, otherwise, please write to Bin Gao at
bin.gao@uit.no.

Afterwards, we may suggest you to run the test suite in Gen1Int lirbary (you
need to comiple Gen1Int library and its test suite by yourself) and the test
of Gen1Int interface in Dalton (those test/gen1int_*), make sure there is no
error. Otherwise, please also write to Bin Gao with detailed error message.
