Environment variables
---------------------

Before starting testing ("make test" or nightly), you should export the
following environment variables::

  export DALTON_TMPDIR=/scratch     # scratch space for Dalton (adapt the path of course)
  export DALTON_MPI_NR_CORES=4      # in this case 4 cores, only relevant if you compile with MPI
