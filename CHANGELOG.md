### New features added
- Added pcH-n and aug-pcH-n basis sets levels 1-4 to Dalton basis set library.
- Extended "super matrix integrals" to work with >255 basis functions. (H. J. Aa. Jensen)
- Calculate and print oscillator strengths based on .EEF dipole transition moments. (H. J. Aa. Jensen)
- Added ".TDA TR" keyword for invoking Tamm-Dancoff approximation for triplet response properties under \*\*PROPERTIES.
  Useful for avoiding (near-)triplet-instability problems, for example in DFT calculations of spin-spin coupling constants. (H. J. Aa. Jensen)
- Added ".TDA SI" keyword for invoking Tamm-Dancoff approximation for singlet response properties under \*\*PROPERTIES. (H. J. Aa. Jensen)
- Added possibility to optimize MCSCF singlet wave functions with CSFs when used for triplet properties,
  both in \*\*RESPONS and \*\*PROPERTIES. Previously .DETERMINANTS in wave function optimization was required. (H. J. Aa. Jensen)
- Added the ability in QFITLIB to fit up to and including quadrupoles (C. Steinmann)
- Added the CVS approximation for CC calculations of core-excited states (S. Coriani et al.)
- Added the possibility to calculate triplet-triplet excited state moments using the EOM-CC approximation (R. Faber)
- New features available through the Polarizable Embedding library (PElib)
  - Polarizable density embedding (PDE) model (use -DENABLE\_PDE=ON during setup to enable it [requires HDF5])
    - J. M. H. Olsen, C. Steinmann, K. Ruud, and J. Kongsted, J. Phys. Chem. A 119, 5344 (2015)
    - P. Reinholdt, J. Kongsted, and J. M. H. Olsen, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 8, 5949 (2017)
  - PDE-CC2, PDE-CCSD, and PDE-CCSDR(3) including linear and quadratic response (also enables PE-CC through PElib)

### Added
- Added information about .MS2 input option to manual, quit if invalid value specified. (H. J. Aa. Jensen)

### Fixed
- Compilation errors with gfortran-9.2.0 and 64-bit integers
- Errors when running DFT with 64-bit integers and MPI. (P. Reinholdt and H. J. Aa. Jensen)
- Errors for Fermi-contact (FC) labels on APROPER and therefore FC properties in \*\*RESPONS when more than 99 atoms (H. J. Aa. Jensen)

- Make sure we include all (near-)degenerate diagonal elements for linear response excitation energies
  via \*\*PROPERTIES .EXCITA or via \*\*RESPONS \*LINEAR .SINGLE (increase .NROOTS if needed).
  Otherwise the calculation will probably exhibit spin and/or space symmetry contamination proportional
  to the convergence threshold. (H. J. Aa. Jensen)
- Never use plus combinations of determinants as start guess for singlet linear response excitation energies
  when reference wave function is not singlet (we do not want singlet states then). (H. J. Aa. Jensen)
- Dalton script: fix for using input files located in subfolders
- Fixed error from March 2015 which meant that double-hybrid DFT was not working correctly (MP2 part was ignored).
- Fixed error for MC-TDA excitation energies for RASSCF (CASSCF was OK).

- Bugfix for .TDA for MCSCF (i.e. zero B matrix in linear response in \*\*RESPONSE).
- Bugfix for .GASCI after .HSROHF

## [2016.1] (2016-04-07)

### Added
- Possibility to read basis set files as made by the EMSL web site
  (this makes it possible to also read basis set files in basis/ based on
  emsl output as e.g. aug-pcseg-1; only LSDALTON has been able to read them so far)

## [2016.0] (2015-12-22)

### Changed
- Separated Dalton and LSDalton.

### Added
- New faster CC3 module (Main authors: Rolf H. Myhre and Henrik Koch)
- Parallel AO-SOPPA (Main authors: Frederik Beyer KjÃ¦r Hansen and Rasmus Faber)
- QFIT library - fitting charges and, if desired, dipoles to simulate the electrostatic potential from a QM wave function: (Main author: Casper Steinmann)
- Vibrational averaging of NMR coupling constants at SOPPA/MP2 level (Main author: Rasmus Faber)

### Fixed (since version 2015.1)
- Ahlrichs-TZV basis: Fixed error in an exponent for Boron.
- ANO-RCC basis: Fixed Carbon basis set (wrong contraction coefficients, see [MOLCAS ANO-RCC](http://www.molcas.org/ANO/).
- ANO-RCC basis: Modified the 3 Th h-functions by replacing them with the 3 Ac h-functions to Th.
                 (A mistake was made in the original work when the 3 Th h-functions were made,
                  and this has never been redone. They are too diffuse, exponents
                  (0.3140887600, 0.1256355100, 0.0502542000) for Th, Z=90, compared to
                  (0.7947153600, 0.3149038200, 0.1259615200) for Ac, Z=89, and
                  (0.8411791300, 0.3310795400, 0.1324318200) for Pa, Z=91.
                  We have selected to just replace the 3 Th h-functions with those from the Ac basis set,
                  because the Ac g-functions are quite close to the Th g-functions, closer than Ac g-functions,
                  and therefore differences in results compared to optimized Th h-functions should be minimal.)
                  Thanks to Kirk Peterson for pointing out the Th problem on http://daltonforum.org.
- Fixed reading of ANO-RCC basis set library file.
- Bug fix for when more than 30 excitation energies requested (EIGENVALUES NOT PAIRED problem reported by Frank Jensen).
- Fixed some bugs for two byte packing of derivative and spin-orbit two-electron integrals.
- Fixed .NEWTRA integral transformation for 32 bit integers and exactly n\*256 orbitals and no integer overflow test
  (the first 32 bits of (n\*256)\*\*4 are zero !!!).
- Improved performance of .NEWTRA integral transformation for response calculations.
- Do not include floating orbitals in calculation of smallest atom-atom distance.
- Enable Tamm-Dancoff approximation (.TDA) for embedding models, e.g. PE, PCM etc.
- Provide date and time stamp also for Darwin (i.e. MacOSX).
- Assume nobody uses gfortran version 4.0.2 any more (removed special test for that).

## [2013.4] (2014-07-10)

### DALTON
- Memory bugfix for serial PCM calculations (segmentation fault for large PCM cavities).

### LSDALTON
- Fixed a bug in the basis set reading. This bugfix affects almost no basis sets,
  and none of the standard basis sets, but a very few general contracted basis sets
  where the first contracted function had much smaller number of
  primitives compared to the last: Basis sets such as the pcS-1 basis set.
- Reduced the memory requirements for internal MPI buffer handling.


## [2013.3] (2014-06-11)

### Common
- aug-cc-pVTZ-lresc basis set added to $BASDIR.

### DALTON
- Default DIIS space increased from 5 to 8, often resulting in 1-2 fewer SCF iterations.
- Removed the maximum of 20 excitations in summary output for second and third order transition moments.
- Warning is issued when orbitals are deleted due to linear dependencies (before SCF),
  AngPso (a 0th order LRESC diamagnetic corr) is not calculated in this case.
- Bugfix for parallel calculations and some type of geometry optimizations with ANO basis sets
  (this bug resulted in aborted calculations, not in wrong results).
- Print irrep names together with symmetry numbers for easier interpretation of output.
- More important output with '@' in column 1 (can be obtained with 'grep @' on the output).
- Environment variable DALTON\_USE\_GLOBAL\_SCRATCH disables copying of binaries to worker nodes.
- Environment variable DALTON\_LAUNCHER introduced.
- Fixed output information about number of MPI processes and number of OpenMP threads.
- Added information in the error messages when values in maxorb.h are exceeded (which values to increase).
- Increased some of the values in the common blocks:
  MXSHEL 1000 -> 1500; MXCORB 2400 -> 5000; MXPRIM 8000 -> 15000;
  MAXOCC 800 -> 1500; MXCENT 200 -> 500; MXCENT\_QM 200 -> 500
  (the static size of dalton.x went from 100 MB to 165 MB).
- Do not print garbage non-zero transition moments and oscillator strengths for triplet excitations (\*EXCITA module).
- Corrected input description for transition moments between excited states (\*QUADRA with .DOUBLE RESIDUE).
- Fix for \*\*RESPONSE .EXMOM .ISPABC=1,0,1 (only half the excited state spin-orbit transition moments were calculated).

- Bugfix for small non-default WORK array sizes. For specific small custom values of the WORK array size
  KBLOCK was larger than MXBLCK leading to unpredictable results due to array length mismatch in DALTON/abacus/herrdn.F.

### LSDALTON
- Environment variable LSDALTON\_LAUNCHER introduced.


## [2013.2] (2014-03-05)

### Common
- Recognize CYGWIN as a LINUX and UNIX system, for proper definition of compilation flags.
- Define M\_PI in C-code if not already defined (problem seen with Cygwin).
- Added setup option --blacs to be used in combination with --scalapack; defaults to --blacs=intelmpi.

### DALTON
- Fixed a bug in printing results in CPP-QRF.
- New CPP solver works also for non-direct calculation.
- More efficient evaluation of numerical Hessian when C1 symmetry
  (in each geometry step start wave function optimization from a
  converged wave function from a neighboring geometry rather than from scratch each time).
- Fix of error which sometimes caused a geometry optimization to stop with "\*\*\* ERROR, Wrong interval in WLKBIS".
- Fix of a bug which occasionally caused DALTON to abort a .STEX calculation.
- Print final geometry in xyz format (angstrom). File called "final\_geometry.xyz" is put into the restart tarball.
- Append PID to scratch directory to avoid multiple tests running in the same directory.
- Improved manual for two-photon and non-adiabatic coupling.
- Updated/corrected g-factors for Ag, Nd, and Tl (thanks to M. Jaszunski).

### LSDALTON
- Print sensible error message when running out of memory.
- Added functionality to search through several basis-set libraries.
- Increased max length of WRKDIR from 60 to 200.
- Fixed a bug related to improper shutdown of MPI calculation. In the case
  of wrong LSDALTON.INP for instance the calculation will issue a error
  statement and afterward hang forever in a MPI call.
- Fixed an OpenMP bug in the calculation of how much memory there should be used during
  an exchange-correlation calculation - resulting in huge memory usage for large molecular system.


## [2013.1] (2013-12-19)

### DALTON
- Correct the printout of relativistic corrections to the shielding (thanks to M. Jaszunski).
- Compilation fix for DALTON/abacus/rma\_windows.F90 (Intel 10.0.011).
- Fix of error where basis set names were changed to upper case and could not be found (reported by Yurij Rusakov).
- Each MPI slave sleeps 10 millisecond between tests for new task
  (only Intel; should enable turbomode in sequential parts of DALTON, and more efficient use of threaded MKL when combined with MPI).
- added metric scaled output of orbital response vectors in \*\*RESPONS
  (for easier interpretation of excitation operators).

### LSDALTON
- Fixed a bug in Jengine, related to screening for nonsymmetric density matrices.
  This may affect CCSD and some response calculation.
- Modified the input section of the manual concerning
  Casida-Salahub asymptotic correction CS00 (thanks to Raul Crespo).
- Changed defaults for Casida-Salahub asymptotic correction CS00 (thanks to Raul Crespo).
- Fixed errors in the MCD B terms output files (.dat files) now one file is generated
  for each B term and each A term (thanks to Raul Crespo).
- Modified the input section of the manual concerning MCD B terms. Added description of MCDEXSTATES.
- Fixed a bug for LSDALTON geometry optimization and dynamics related to
  screening. The initial Cauchy-Schwartz screening matrices were incorrectly
  used in each subsequent geometry step
