\chapter{Polarizable embedding calculations}\label{ch:embedding}

This chapter describes the polarizable embedding (PE) environment model~\cite{pescf,pesoppa,pecc}\index{polarizable embedding}\index{PE}\index{environment model}\index{embedding model}\index{embedding}\index{QM/MM} as implemented in the PE library~\cite{pelib2012} that has been interfaced with {\dalton}. The implementation uses the Gen1Int library to calculate one-electron integrals~\cite{gen1int}. The first section provides some general considerations about the model and the second section describes the input.

\section{General considerations}
In {\dalton} it is possible to include the effects from a structured environment on a core molecular system using the polarizable embedding (PE) model. The current implementation is a dual-layered QM/MM-type embedding model capable of using advanced potentials that include an electrostatic component as well as an induction (polarization) component. The effects of the environment are included through effective operators that include an embedding potential, which is a representation of the environment, thereby directly affecting the molecular properties of the core system. The wave function of the core system is optimized while taking into account the explicit electrostatic interactions and induction effects from the environment in a fully self-consistent manner. The electrostatic and induction components are modeled using (distributed/localized) Cartesian multipole moments and anisotropic dipole-dipole polarizabilities, respectively. The electrostatic part models the permanent charge distribution of the environment and will polarize the core system, while the induction part also allows mutual polarization between the core system and the environment and within the environment itself, thus including also many-body effects of the total system.

The multipoles and polarizabilities can be obtained in many different ways. It is possible to use the molecular properties, however, usually distributed/localized properties are used because of the better convergence of the multipole expansion. These are typically centered on all atomic sites in the environment (and sometimes also bond-midpoints), however, the implementation is general in this sense so they can be placed anywhere in space. Currently, multipole moments up to 5th order and anisotropic dipole-dipole polarizabilities are supported. The multipole moments are expected to be traceless, however, for moments up to and including octopoles the trace will be removed if present. In case polarizabilities are included it might be necessary to use an exclusion list to ensure that only relevant sites can polarize each other. The format of the \potinp\ file is demonstrated below.

The PE model is implemented for HF, DFT, MP2\footnote{environment response is based on HF} and CC wave functions. Singlet linear response may be evaluated at PE-HF, PE-DFT, PE-SOPPA\footnote{using HF environment response}, PE-CC2 and PE-CCSD\footnote{PE-CC uses an older implementation} levels of theory. In addition, quadratic response properties are available at the PE-HF and PE-DFT levels for closed-shell systems only. Note, that the current implementation does not support point-group symmetry, London atomic orbitals or analytical molecular gradients and Hessians.


\section{Input description}
The following input description is relevant only for PE-HF, PE-DFT and PE-MP2/SOPPA. The PE-CC input is described in subsection~\ref{sec:pecc}. To include environment effects using the polarizable embedding (PE) model it is necessary to define the core and environment part of the system: the \molinp\ file specifies the core molecular system and the \potinp\ file that contains the embedding potential which describes the environment. Moreover, additional keywords are needed in the \dalinp\ input file to activate the PE model. To use default options it is only necessary to include \Key{PEQM} in the \Sec{*DALTON} section. For example, to calculate the PE-HF wave function the following input can be used
\begin{verbatim}
**DALTON
.RUN WAVE FUNCTIONS
.PEQM
**WAVE FUNCTIONS
.HF
**END OF DALTON
\end{verbatim}
To use non-default options a \Sec{PEQM} subsection is needed also in the \Sec{*DALTON} section. For instance, to use the direct solver for induced dipoles the following input example can be used
\begin{verbatim}
**DALTON
.RUN WAVE FUNCTIONS
.PEQM
*PEQM
.DIRECT
**WAVE FUNCTIONS
.HF
**END OF DALTON
\end{verbatim}
See further input options in Chapter~\ref{ch:general} under the \Sec{PEQM} input section (subsection~\ref{subsec:peqm}). Furthermore, Section~\ref{sec:daltoninp} in Chapter~\ref{ch:starting} provides an introduction to the \dalton\ input in general. The format of the \molinp\ file is described in \ref{ch:molinp} and requires no additional changes to be used in a PE calculation.

\subsection*{The \potinp\ file}
The \potinp\ input file is split into three sections: coordinates, multipoles and polarizabilities. The format is perhaps best illustrated using an example

where the values have been truncated for readability.

\subsubsection*{coordinates}
The coordinates section follows the standard XYZ file format so that the environment can be easily visualized using standard programs. The first line in gives the total number of sites in the environment and the second line specifies whether the coordinates are given in \AA{}ngstr\"{o}m (\verb|AA|) or Bohr (\verb|AU|). The rest of the coordinates section is a list of the sites in the environment where each line contains the element symbol and x-, y- and z-coordinates of a site. If a site is not located on an atom, e.g. if it is a bond-midpoint, then the element symbol should be specified as \verb|X|. The listing also gives an implicit numbering of the sites, so that the first line is site number one, the second line is site number two and so on. This numbering is important and used in the following sections.

\subsubsection*{multipoles}
The multipoles section is subdivided into the orders of the multipoles, i.e.\ \verb|order 0| for monopoles/charges, \verb|order 1| for dipoles and so on. For each order there is a number specifying the number of multipoles of that specific order. Note, that this number does not have to be equal to the total number of sites. This is followed by a list of multipoles where each line gives the multipole of a site. The lines begin with a number that specifies which site the multipole is placed. Only the symmetry-independent Cartesian multipoles should be provided using an ordering such that the components are stepped from the right, e.g.\ \verb|xx xy xz yy yz zz| or \verb|xxx xxy xxz xyy xyz xzz yyy yyz yzz zzz|. Note, that the multipoles should in general be traceless, however, for multipoles up to and including octopoles (i.e.\ \verb|order 3|) the trace is removed if present. Furthermore, the current implementation is limited to fifth order multipoles.

\subsubsection*{polarizabilities}
The polarizabilities section is also subdivided into orders, i.e.\ \verb|order 1 1| for dipole-dipole polarizabilities, which is the only type supported in this release. The format is the same as for multipoles, i.e. first line contains number of polarizabilities which is followed by a list of the polarizabilities using the same ordering as the multipoles. In addition, there is also the exclusion lists (\verb|exclists| section). Here the first line gives the number of lists (i.e.\ the number of lines) and the length of the exclusion lists (i.e.\ the number of entries per line). The exclusion lists specify what the polarizable sites are not allowed to be polarized by, e.g.\ \verb|1 2 3 4 5| means that site number 1 cannot be polarized by sites 2, 3, 4 and 5.

\subsection{PE-CC calculations}\label{sec:pecc}
The PE-CC calculations in the current release uses an older implementation and therefore requires different input. More coming...
