\chapter{Installation}\label{ch:install}

\section{Hardware/software
supported}\label{sec:hardsoft}\index{hardware/software support}

{\dalton} can be run on a variety of systems running the UNIX
operating system. The current release of the program supports
%Cray-UNICOS\index{Cray},
%Cray-T3D/E\index{Cray!T3D}\index{Cray!T3E}\index{Cray},
%HP-UX,
IBM-AIX\index{IBM-AIX},
Linux\index{Linux} using gfortran, pgf90/95 or ifort, and 
MacOS X (darwin)\index{MacOSX} using xlf/xlc or gfortran/gcc.
%We furthermore note that response calculations involving the
%spin--orbit\index{spin-orbit} operator only will work on some of these
%computers (more details are given in the file
%\verb|dalton/test/KNOWN_PROBLEMS|).

The program is written in FORTRAN~77\index{FORTRAN~77}, 
FORTRAN~90\index{FORTRAN~90} and C~\index{C}, with
machine dependencies isolated using C preprocessor directives\index{C preprocessor}.  
All floating-point computations are performed in 64-bit precision, 
but if 32-bit integers are available the code will take advantage of this to reduce storage
requirements in some sections.

The program should be easily portable to other UNIX
platforms\index{porting}.
Users who port the codes to other platforms are encouraged to
communicate any required changes in the original source with the
appropriate C preprocessor directives to the authors.

\section{Source files}\label{sec:source}

{\dalton} is distributed as a \verb|tar| file obtainable from
the {\dalton} homepage\\
(\verb|http://www.daltonprogram.org|) if the
license agreement for the program has been completed and returned to
the authors.  If you have accessed this documentation off the
\verb|tar|\index{tar-file} file you will
already know how to extract the required directory structure, but
for completeness, assuming the \verb|tar| file is called
\verb|dalton.tar.gz|\index{tar-file}, the commands
\begin{verbatim}
gunzip dalton.tar.gz
tar xf dalton.tar
\end{verbatim}
will produce the following subdirectory structure in the current
directory:
\begin{verbatim}
dalton/abacus    dalton/densfit    dalton/eri       dalton/pdpack     dalton/test_cc
dalton/amfi      dalton/dft        dalton/gp        dalton/rsp        dalton/tools
dalton/basis     dalton/dftxcfun   dalton/include   dalton/sirius
dalton/cc        dalton/Doc        dalton/lucita    dalton/soppa
dalton/choles    dalton/Doc_cc     dalton/modules   dalton/test
\end{verbatim}
Most of the subdirectories contain source code for the different sections
constituting the program (\verb|abacus|, \verb|amfi|, \verb|cc|, \verb|choles|, \verb|densfit|,
\verb|dft|, \verb|eri|, \verb|gp|, \verb|lucita|,\verb|rsp| and \verb|sirius|, and \verb|soppa|). Furthermore,
there's a directory containing
various public domain routines (\verb|pdpack|), a directory with the
necessary include files containing common blocks and
machine dependent routines (\verb|include|), a directory 
which will (after compilation) contain necessary module files (\verb|modules|), 
a directory containing all the basis sets supplied with this distribution (\verb|basis|), a
fairly large set of test jobs including reference output files
(\verb|test|, \verb|test_cc|), a directory containing some useful pre- and
post-processing programs supplied to us from various users
(\verb|tools|), and finally this documentation (\verb|Doc|). 

In addition to the directories, the main dalton directory will
contain several files including a shell script (\verb|configure|)
which will build a suitable \verb|Makefile.config| for use when
installing the program. The \verb|configure| script will also create a
\verb|Makefile| and a run script \verb|bin/dalton| from the skeletal files
(\verb|Makefile.in| and \verb|dalton.gnr|) that are present in the
directory.


\section{Installing the program using the
Makefile}\label{sec:Makefile}
\index{Makefile}
\index{installation!Makefile}
\index{installation!Makefile.config}

The program is easily installed through the use of the supplied
\verb|configure| script\index{configure script}. Based on the
automatically guessed architecture, the
script will try to build a suitable
\verb|Makefile.config|\index{Makefile.config} on the
basis of what kind of mathematical libraries are found, and user
input. Thus, to execute the script, type
\begin{verbatim}
> ./configure
\end{verbatim}

\bigskip

If the automatic hosttype detection (which usually works fine for most common
platforms) is not correct, the user may provide the correct \verb|<architecture>|\ type 
to the script by typing
\begin{verbatim}
> ./configure -<architecture>
\end{verbatim}

\bigskip

Although this script in most cases is capable of making a correct
\verb|Makefile.config|, we always recommend users to check the created
\verb|Makefile.config| against local system set-up. 

During the execution of the \verb|configure| script, you will be
asked a few questions, most of which require a quite obvious
answer. Let us only comment upon five of the questions asked:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 64-bit integers\index{64-bit integers}\index{installation!64-bit}:
When installing \dalton\ on a 64-bit architecture (for example Linux x86\_64) 
the user will be asked if 64-bit integers should be used throughout the program. 
\dalton\ is designed such that it can be excuted with either 32-bit or 64-bit 
integers but in some cases it may be advantageous and/or compulsory 
to use 64-bit integers, e.g., memory allocation for more than 16Gbytes  
of scratch-memory (see also next paragraph) and execution of some modules 
with more than 255 basis functions.

\item Scratch memory\index{scratch memory}\index{installation!memory}
size: Dalton uses approximately 6.5 Mwords (54 Mbytes)
in static memory allocations. The program defines a large scratch-memory
array, from which it allocates space for temporary arrays
during the execution of the program. This value is given in Words, and
should be chosen according to available memory on your computer.
\verb|WRKMEM| may be changed at execution time by supplying a
different value for \verb|WRKMEM| through the shell script running
{\dalton}.

\item Default basis set library
\index{basis set!library}
\index{installation!basis set library}
location: This defines the directory where the program will look for the
basis sets supplied with the distribution, and this need to be
changed according to the local directory structure. We recommend
that the basis sets in this directory are {\em not} changed, but
that changes to the basis set rather is done in a separate
directory, and then supply this basis set directory to the program
at execution time using the \verb|dalton -b basdir| option.

{\sc NOTE TO SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS:} Supplied with {\dalton} is an
extensive basis set library. This basis set directory must be made
readable to all users. {\sc END NOTE}

\item Default scratch
space\index{scratch space}\index{installation!scratch space}:
Determines the default head scratch
directory where temporary files will be placed. This value will be put
in the \verb|dalton| run script. However, note that jobs will be run in
a subdirectory of this head scratch-directory, according to the name
of the job files. If \verb|/work| or \verb|/scratch| is defined in the
local directory structure, the script will normally suggest
\verb|/work/$USER| or  \verb|/scratch/$USER| as default head scratch space.

\item Default install 
directory\index{install directory}\index{installation!install directory}:
Denotes the directory where the {\dalton} executable and the
\verb|dalton| run script will be moved to.
Default: a subdirectory {\tt ./bin} to the main \dalton\ directory.
\end{enumerate}

Compiler options will be supplied in \verb|Makefile.config|, in the manner
we use ourselves. {\em These options often do not include aggressive
optimization\index{optimization (f90)}, as
it is our experience that
the code is optimized incorrectly if the optimization is too
aggressive.} The proper options to the C preprocessor for an ordinary
installation of the program are also supplied with
\verb|Makefile.config|\index{Makefile.config}.

The \verb|configure| script attempts to detect mathematical libraries
available on the system and use them whenever possible. {\dalton} can
use third-party BLAS and LAPACK libraries or libraries providing
equivalent functionality like ESSL on AIX, ATLAS, ACML, MKL on Intel
architectures.
You will be asked which one you want of the found libraries.
You can also point the \verb|configure|
script to the location of the preferred libraries by setting
\verb|LIBDIR| environment variable before running the script. For
example, if one has high-performance BLAS routines in \verb|mylibs|
subdirectory of the user's home directory, \verb|configure| script can
be instructed to use them as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
env LIBDIR=\$HOME/mylibs ./configure
\end{verbatim}


NOTE: If problems with I/O\index{I/O-problems} are experienced on
any computer,
manifesting themselves as error messages saying that a read statement
has passed the EOF mark, the *.F files in the gp directories should be
touched, and the code rebuilt using the additional C preprocessor
directive \verb|VAR_MFDS| ("MFDS" for Multi File Data Sets).

When  \verb|Makefile.config|\index{Makefile.config} has been properly
created and checked
to agree with local system set-up, all that is needed
to build an executable\index{building an executable} version of the
code is to type
(in the same directory as the \verb|Makefile.config| file):
\begin{verbatim}
> make
\end{verbatim}

NOTE: If you encounter a (similar) error message as described in the following during the 
compilation of a parallel \dalton\ version, please follow one of the advices given below. 
\begin{verbatim}
> make
> lot's of output ...
> Error:
> ... This module file was not generated by any release of this compiler.   [MPI]
>   use mpi
> ------^
\end{verbatim}
The error message arises due to a mismatch between the F90 compiler which 
has been used to compile the \verb|mpi.mod|\index{mpi.mod} module of your MPI-library 
and the F90 compiler which has been chosen to compile \dalton. 
Two possible solutions are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item add the C preprocessor directive \verb|VAR_USE_MPIF|\ to \verb|CPPFLAGS|\ in \verb|Makefile.config|\index{Makefile.config} 
and recompile \dalton.
\item ask your local system administrator to provide you with a MPI-library which has been 
set up and compiled with the identical F90 compiler version which you have chosen for \dalton.
\end{enumerate}
Although most likely being more cumbersome, we recommend solution 2. The simple solution 1 bypasses the 
F90 type checking and argument list checking functionalities of F90 which is preferable in order to 
easily identify programming bugs.

For MacOS X\index{MacOSX}, the program may be installed either with the IBM
xlf compiler for best performance or with the gfortran/ifort compiler. Be sure
to use the latest Xcode from \verb|http://developer.apple.com/|.

\section{Running the {\dalton} test suite}\label{sec:testsuite}
\index{test suite}\index{installation!test suite}

To check that {\dalton} has been successfully installed, a fairly
elaborate automatic test suite is provided in the distribution. A test
script, all the test jobs and reference output files can be found in
the \verb|dalton/test| directory. It is highly recommended that all
these tests be run once the program has been compiled. Depending on
your hardware, this usually takes 2---12 hours.

The tests can be run one by one or in groups, by using the test script
\verb|TEST|. Try \verb|TEST -h| to see the different options this
script takes. Also, have a look at \verb|CONTENTS|
for short descriptions of the various tests. To run the
complete test suite, simply go to the \verb|dalton/test| directory and
type:
\begin{verbatim}
> ./TEST all
\end{verbatim}
You can follow the progress of the tests directly, but all messages
are also printed to a log (\verb|TESTLOG| by default). After all the
tests have completed you should hopefully be presented with the
message ``ALL TESTS ENDED PROPERLY!''. If not, you will be given a
list of the tests that failed to run correctly. Please consult the file
\verb|KNOWN_PROBLEMS| too see if these tests have documented problems
on your particular platform.

Any tests that fail will leave behind the \verb|.mol| and \verb|.dal|
input-files (these are described in more detail in
Chapter~\ref{ch:starting}), and the output-file from the test
calculation which will have the extension \verb|.log| ({\dalton}
output-files usually have the extension \verb|.out|). For all
successful tests all files, except the output-file (\verb|.log|),
will be deleted as soon as the output has been checked, unless
\verb|TEST| is being run with the option \verb|-keep|.

If most of the tests fail, it is quite likely that there's something
\index{troubleshooting}\index{installation!troubleshooting}
wrong with the installation. Look carefully through
\verb|Makefile.config|, and consider turning down or even off
optimization.

If there's only a few tests that fail, and {\dalton} seems to exit
normally in each case, there may just be some issues with numerical
accuracy. Different machines give slightly different results, and
while we've tried to allow for some slack in the tests, it may be
that your machine yields numbers just outside the intervals we've
specified as acceptable. A closer comparison of the results with
numbers in the test script and/or the reference output files should
reveal whether this is actually the case. If numerical (in)accuracy is
the culprit, feel free to send your output-file(s) to
\verb|dalton-admin@kjemi.uio.no| so that we can adjust the numerical
intervals accordingly.
