\section{\label{sec:sirius-ref-notes} General notes for the {\sir} input reference
manual}

{\sir} is the part of the code that computes the wave function/density.

The following sections contain a list of all generally relevant keywords to
{\sir}, only currently inactive keywords and some special debug
options are omitted.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {The input for the wave function section must begin with

\begin{inputex} \begin{verbatim}
**WAVE FUNCTIONS
\end{verbatim} \end{inputex}
   with no leading blanks.  The preceding lines in the input file may
   contain arbitrary information.
}
\item{ Input is directed by keywords written in upper case.
   Only the first 7 characters including the prompt are significant.
   The keywords are divided in a number of main input groups. Each main
   input group is initiated by a {\starkey}. For example

\begin{inputex} \begin{verbatim}
*ORBITAL INPUT
\end{verbatim} \end{inputex}
   marks the beginning of the input group for orbital input.
}
\item { The keywords belonging to one of the main input groups begin with
   the prompt {\dotkey}.
}
\item { Keywords that are necessary to specify are marked by "Required".
   For other keywords the default values can be used in ordinary runs.
}
\item {Any keyword line beginning with a \quotekw{!} or
   \quotekw{\#} will be treated as a
   comment line.  An illegal keyword will cause a dump of all keywords
   for the current input section.
}
\item{A dump of keywords can be obtained in any input section by
specifying the keyword \quotekw{\Key{OPTIONS}}.  For example, the input

\begin{inputex} \begin{verbatim}
**WAVE FUNCTIONS
.OPTIONS
**END OF DALTON INPUT
\end{verbatim} \end{inputex}
   will cause a dump of the labels for the main input groups in {\sir},
   while

\begin{inputex} \begin{verbatim}
**WAVE FUNCTIONS
*ORBITAL INPUT
.OPTIONS
**END OF DALTON INPUT
\end{verbatim} \end{inputex}
   will cause a dump of the labels for the \quotekw{*ORBITAL INPUT} input group
   in {\sir}.
}
\item{ The {\sir} input is finished with a line beginning with two stars,
   {\it e.g.\/}

\begin{inputex} \begin{verbatim}
**END OF DALTON INPUT
\end{verbatim} \end{inputex}
}
\end{enumerate}

\section{\label{sec:ref-newinp}
   Main input groups in the **WAVE FUNCTIONS input module}

\noindent
The main input groups (those with the {\starkey} prompt) are listed here and
the full descriptions are given in the designated sections.

\noindent
The first input group is always required in order to specify the type of
calculation, and follows immediately after the \Sec{*WAVE FUNCTIONS}
keyword.

%Section~\ref{ref-geninp} \Sec{GENERAL INPUT}

\noindent The remaining input groups may be specified in any
order. In this chapter they are grouped alphabetically, although
the short presentation below gather them according to purpose.

%\ifsolvent
The following two input groups are used to modify the
molecular environment by adding field-dependent
terms in the Hamiltonian and by invoking
the self-consistent reaction field model for solvent
effects, respectively:

Section~\ref{ref-haminp} \Sec{HAMILTONIAN}

Section~\ref{ref-solinp} \Sec{SOLVENT}
%\else
%The following input group describes additional field-dependent
%terms in the Hamiltonian :
%
%Section~\ref{ref-haminp} \Sec{HAMILTONIAN}
%\fi

\noindent
The next input group specifies the configurations included
in the MCSCF and CI wave functions:

Section~\ref{ref-wavinp} \Sec{CONFIGURATION INPUT}

\noindent
The two next groups are used to specify initial orbitals and initial
guess for the CI vector:

Section~\ref{ref-orbinp} \Sec{ORBITAL INPUT}

Section~\ref{ref-civinp} \Sec{CI VECTOR}

\noindent
The two following input groups control the second-order MCSCF
optimization:

Section~\ref{ref-optinp} \Sec{OPTIMIZATION}

Section~\ref{ref-stpinp} \Sec{STEP CONTROL}

\noindent
The next groups have special input only relevant for the
specified calculation types:

Section~\ref{ref-rhfinp} \Sec{SCF INPUT}, for \Key{HF} (or \Key{SCF}) and \Key{DFT}

Section~\ref{ref-dftinp} \Sec{DFT INPUT}, for \Key{DFT}

Section~\ref{ref-mp2inp} \Sec{MP2 INPUT}, for \Key{MP2}

Section~\ref{ref-nevpt2inp} \Sec{NEVPT2 INPUT}, for \Key{NEVPT2}

Section~\ref{ref-cicinp} \Sec{CI INPUT}, for \Key{CI}

Section~\ref{ref-stexinp} \Sec{STEX INPUT}, for \Key{STEX}

\noindent
The next section is used to select some types of analysis of the final
Hartree--Fock, DFT, MCSCF, or CI wave function:

Section~\ref{ref-popinp} \Sec{POPULATION ANALYSIS}

\noindent
The next section is used to change the default integral transformation
and specify any final integral transformation after convergence (a
program following {\sir} may need a higher transformation level):

Section~\ref{ref-trainp} \Sec{TRANSFORMATION}

\noindent
The next two input groups control the amount of printed output and
collect options not fitting in any of the other groups:

Section~\ref{ref-priinp} \Sec{PRINT LEVELS}

Section~\ref{ref-auxinp} \Sec{AUXILIARY INPUT}

\noindent
Finally we note that there is an input module controlling the
calculation of coupled cluster wave functions. This is treated in a
separate chapter:

Chapter~\ref{ch:CC} \Sec{CC INPUT}

\bigskip
\noindent
The wave function input is finished when a line is encountered beginning
with two stars, for example

\begin{inputex} \begin{verbatim}
   **END OF DALTON INPUT
\end{verbatim} \end{inputex}
or

\begin{inputex} \begin{verbatim}
   **MOLORB
   ... formatted molecular orbitals coefficients
   **END OF DALTON INPUT
\end{verbatim} \end{inputex}

\noindent
The \Sec{*MOLORB} keyword or the \Sec{*NATORB} keyword
must be somewhere on the input file and be
followed by molecular orbital coefficients if the option for formatted
input of molecular orbitals has been specified.  Apart from this
requirement, arbitrary information can be written to the following lines
of the input file.

\subsection{\label{ref-geninp}\Sec{*WAVE FUNCTIONS}}

{\bf Purpose:}

Specification of which wave function calculation is to be performed.

{\bf Primary keywords, listed in the order the corresponding modules
 will be executed by the program (if the keyword is set): }

\begin{description}

\item[\Key{HF}]
  Restricted closed-shell or one open-shell 
  Hartree--Fock\index{HF}\index{SCF}\index{Hartree--Fock}\index{open shell!HF} calculation.
  The occupied orbitals, optimization control etc. are specified in the
  \quotekw{*SCF INPUT} submodule.
  Note: you cannot specify both \quotekw{.HF} and \quotekw{.DFT} keywords.

%\item[\Key{SCF}]
%  Alias for \Key{HF}. Deprecated.

\item[\Key{DFT}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,'(A80)') LINE} \\
  Restricted closed-shell, one
  open-shell or high-spin spin-restricted Kohn-Sham density functional
  theory\index{DFT}\index{Kohn--Sham}\index{open shell!DFT}
  calculation.  On the following line you must specify which
  functional to use.  The occupied orbitals, optimization control
  etc. are specified in the \quotekw{*SCF INPUT} submodule shared with
  the \quotekw{.HF} option.  The DFT specific input options are
  collected in the \quotekw{*DFT INPUT} input submodule.
  Note: you cannot specify both \quotekw{.HF} and \quotekw{.DFT} keywords.

\item[\Key{MP2}]
 \index{M{\o}ller-Plesset!second-order}\index{MP2}
  M{\o}ller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory calculation.
  Requires \quotekw{.HF} or previously calculated canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals.

\item[(\quotekw{.FC MVO} in \quotekw{*SCF INPUT}]
  Calculation of modified virtual SCF orbitals based on the
  potential determined by the keyword (see comments below).
  The occupied SCF orbitals are not modified.
  Note that this keyword is not located in this module but in the
  \quotekw{*SCF INPUT} submodule. It is mentioned here to make clear
  at what point this transformation will be performed, if requested.

\item[\Key{CI}]
  \index{CI}\index{Configuration Interaction}
  Configuration interaction calculation.

\item[\Key{MCSCF}]
  Multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculation.\index{MCSCF}

\item[\Key{VIRTRUNC}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) N, THR\_VIRTUNC} \\
  Truncate virtual space after SCF or MCSCF, write reduced orbital information to 
  "\verb|SIRIUS.RST|" and stop \dalton. Start a new \dalton\ calculation with the
  reduced set of molecular orbitals using ".MOSTART NEWORB" and, if MCSCF, ".STARTOLDCI"
  in the relevant input sections (the ".RESTART" option cannot be used).
  In input N is either 2 or 4, and all virtual orbitals with eigenvalues of
  $r^N$ greater than ( THR\_VIRTRUNC )$^N$ are deleted.
  The THR\_VIRTRUNC is thus a measure of the maximum extent (diffuseness) of a virtual orbital.
  All the occupied orbitals are not modified.

\item[\Key{NEVPT2}]
  Multireference second-order perturbation theory calculation.\index{NEVPT2}

\item[\Key{STEX}]
  Static exchange calculation.\index{Static exchange}

\item[\Key{CC}]
  \index{Coupled Cluster}\index{CC}
  Coupled cluster calculation. Automatically activates Hartree--Fock (\quotekw{.HF}).
  After the Hartree--Fock calculation,
  the \cc\ module is called to do a coupled cluster (response) calculation.
  For further input options for the \cc\ module see Section~\ref{sec:ccgeneral}. 

\item[\Key{CC ONLY}] Skip the calculation of a Hartree--Fock wave
  function, and start directly in the coupled cluster part. Convenient
  for restarts in the coupled cluster module.

%    Alias for the \quotekw{\Key{HF}} keyword.

\item[\Key{STOP}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,'(A20)') REWORD} \\
  Terminate {\sir} according to the instruction given on the following line.

%hjaaj Oct 2003: obsolete
%\item[\Key{BASIS SET}]

\end{description}

%hj%\noindent{\bf Comments:}

%\ifabacus ABACUS: 
%If the full molecular Hessian is calculated in
%ABACUS and the number of symmetries (\verb|NSYM|) is greater than
%one, then the MCSCF wave function will be automatically calculated
%in determinants\index{determinants} and, if singlet,
%\quotekw{.PLUS COMBINATIONS}).  This is so because the CSFs can
%only have one spatial symmetry, and it is generally necessary to
%solve linear response equations of several symmetries to get the
%full molecular Hessian. 
%\fi

%hjaaj Oct 2003: obsolete
%BASIS SET is provided such that the number of basis functions in each
%symmetry may be specified if {\sir} is modified to interface to an
%integral program which doesn't write this information to the integral
%file.

\pagebreak[3]
\subsection{\label{ref-auxinp}\Sec{AUXILIARY INPUT}}

{\bf Purpose:}

Input which does not naturally fit into any of the other
categories.

\begin{description}
\item[\Key{NOSUPMAT}]
  Do not use P-SUPERMATRIX integrals, but calculate Fock matrices
  from AO integrals (slower, but requires less disk space). The
  default is to use the supermatrix file if it exists. See option
  \Key{NOSUP} in Chapter~\ref{sec:herminp}.

%\item[\Key{ONESUP}]
%  Use same unit for P-SUPERMATRIX\index{supermatrix} and ONE-ELECTRON
%  integrals \index{one-electron integral}
%  (LUSUPM=LUONEL, default is different units).
\end{description}

\pagebreak[3]
\subsection{\label{ref-cicinp}\Sec{CI INPUT}}

{\bf Purpose:}

Options for a CI calculation.

\begin{description}
\item[\Key{CIDENSITY}]
  Calculate CI one-electron density matrix and natural
  orbital\index{natural orbital}
  occupations after convergence.

\item[\Key{CINO}]
  Generate CI\index{CI}\index{Configuration Interaction} natural
  orbitals\index{natural orbital} for CI root
  number \kw{ISTACI},
  clear the \verb|SIRIUS.RST| file and write the orbitals with label \quotekw{NEWORB  }.
  The \quotekw{\Key{STATE}} option must be specified.

\item[\Key{CIROOTS}]
  Default: One root.\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) NROOCI} \\
  Converge the lowest \kw{NROOCI} CI roots\index{root!CI} to threshold.

\item[\Key{DISKH2}]
  Active two-electron MO integrals on disk (see comments below).

\item[\Key{MAX ITERATIONS}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) MXCIMA} \\
  Max iterations in iterative diagonalization of CI matrix (default = 20).

\item[\Key{STATE}]
  Default: not specified\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) ISTACI} \\
  Alternative to \quotekw{\Key{CIROOTS}}.  Converge root number \kw{ISTACI}
  to threshold, converge all lower roots only to THQMIN
  (from the \quotekw{\Sec{OPTIMIZATION}} input group, see
  p.~\pageref{ref-optinp}).

\item[\Key{THRESH}]
  Default = 1.D-05\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) THRCI} \\
  Threshold for CI energy gradient.  The CI energy will be converged to
  approximately the square of this number.

\item[\Key{THRPWF}]
  Default is 0.05 for electronic ground states, and 0.10 for excited states.\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) THRPWF} \\
  Only CI coefficients of absolut value greater than threshold are printed
  (PWF: print wave function).

\item[\Key{WEIGHTED RESIDUALS}]
  Use energy weighted residuals\index{residual} (see comments below).

\item[\Key{ZEROELEMENTS}]
  Zero small elements in CI trial vectors (see comments below).
\end{description}


\noindent{\bf Comments:}

DISKH2: By default the CI module will attempt to place the two-electron
integrals with four active indices in memory for more efficient
calculation of CI sigma vectors, if memory is insufficient for this
the
integrals will automatically be placed on disk.  The DISKH2 keyword
forces the integrals always to be on disk.

WEIGHTED RESIDUALS:  Normally the CI states will be converged to a
residual less than the specified threshold, and this will give
approximately the squared number of decimal places in the energy.
Depending on the value of the energy, the eigenvectors will be converged
to different accuracy. If the eigenvectors are wanted with, for instance at
least 6 decimal places for property calculations, specify a threshold of
1.0D-6 and weighted residuals.

ZEROELEMENTS: an experimental option that might save time (if the CI
module can use sparseness) by zeroing all elements less than 1.0D-3
times the largest element in the CI trial vector before
orthonormalization against previous trial vectors.
See also \quotekw{.SYM CHECK} under \quotekw{*OPTIMIZATION}
(p.~\pageref{ref-optinp}).

  Select CSF (or determinant if \quotekw{\Key{DETERMINANTS}}) no.
  ICONF as start configuration.\index{configuration!start}

\item[\Key{STARTHDIAGONAL}]
  Select configurations corresponding to the lowest diagonal elements in
  the configuration part of the Hessian (this is the default option).

\item[\Key{STARTOLDCI}]
  Start from old CI-vector stored saved on the \verb|SIRIUS.RST| file.

%\ifabacus
%\item[.ABACUS]
%  Geometry walk, use CI vector and "GEOSAVE" information saved by
%  ABACUS at previous geometry.  The "GEOSAVE" information is used
%  to decide as early as possible in the wave function optimization
%  if the step should be rejected, thus saving CPU time if the step
%  is rejected.
%\fi

\pagebreak[3]
\subsection{\label{ref-wavinp}\Sec{CONFIGURATION INPUT}}

{\bf Purpose:}

  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) NACTEL} \\
  Number of active electrons\index{active electrons} (the number of
  electrons to be distributed in the active orbitals).
  The total number of electrons is this number
  plus two times the total number of inactive orbitals.

  Minimum and maximum number of holes\index{electron hole} in RAS1; alternative
  to \quotekw{\Key{RAS1 ELECTRONS}}

\item[\Key{RAS1 SPACE}] \ \\
   \kw{READ (LUINP,*) (NAS1(I),I=1,NSYM)} \\
   RAS calculation: RAS1 orbital space\index{RAS1 orbital space}

\item[\Key{RAS2 SPACE}] \ \\
   \kw{READ (LUINP,*) (NAS2(I),I=1,NSYM)} \\
   RAS calculation: RAS2 orbital space\index{RAS2 orbital space}

\item[\Key{RAS3 ELECTRONS}] \ \\

\item[\Key{RAS3 SPACE}] \ \\
   \kw{READ (LUINP,*) (NAS3(I),I=1,NSYM)} \\

\item[\Key{SPIN MULTIPLICITY}]
  Default is 1 for even number of electrons, 2 for odd number of electrons. \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) ISPIN}\\
  For CSF basis: state spin multiplicity\index{spin multiplicity} = $2S + 1$,
  where $S$ is the spin quantum number. \\

\end{description}

\noindent{\bf Comments:}

\noindent SYMMETRY   Specifies total spatial symmetry of the wave
function in $D_{2h}$ symmetry or one of its subgroups: $C_{2v}$, $C_2h$,
$D_2$, $C_s$, $C_i$, $C_2$, $C_1$. The  symmetry number of wave
function follows MOLECULE output ordering of symmetries ($D_{2h}$
subgroup irreps).

\noindent
CAS and RAS\index{RASSCF}\index{CASSCF}\index{MCSCF} are exclusive and
both cannot be specified in the same
MCSCF or CI\index{MCSCF}\index{CI}\index{Configuration Interaction}
calculation. One of them {\em must} be specified.

\pagebreak[3]
\subsection{\label{ref-dftinp}\Sec{DFT INPUT}}

{\bf Purpose:}

To specify the parameters of the DFT integration and the optional use of empirical corrections.

\begin{description}

\item[\Key{DFTAC}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) RTYPE} \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) CTYPE} \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) DFTIPTA, DFTIPTB, DFTBR1, DFTBR2} \\
  Switches on the asymptotic correction of the exchange correlation potential. This correction is a pointwise manipulation of the 
  exchange--correlation potential. This implies activation of the .DFTVXC keyword in the SCF stage. RTYPE defines the
  potential to be used to replace the asymptotic GGA potential, possible options are MULTPOLE (a simple multipole model)
  and LB94 (the potential from the LB94 model potential~\cite{dft:lb94}). CTYPE defines how the potential of the parent
  functional is connected to the asymptotic model, possible options are LINEAR (as used in the Tozer-Handy correction~\cite{dft:th}), 
  TANH (a modified connection by Tozer~\cite{dft:tanh}, which removes discontinuities associated with linear interpolation) and 
  GRAC (the gradient-regulated asymptotic correction of Gr\"uning \emph{et. al.}~\cite{dft:grac}).  \\
  Four numerical input parameters are then input
  the first two are the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ionization potentials (either calculated or experimental). If GRAC is chosen for the 
  connection type then the last two value specify the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (see Ref.~\cite{dft:grac} for details). 
  Recommended values are 0.5 and 40.0. Otherwise the last two parameters specify multiples of the 
  Bragg Radii and are used to define the core, interpolation and asymptotic regions. For grid points within DFTBR1 Bragg Radii of 
  each atom the potential is unmodified, for points outside DFTBR2 Bragg Radii the potential is replaced with its asymptotic model.
  In between the interpolation model is used. Recommended values in this case are 3.5 and 4.7. Care should be taken when 
  choosing alternative values for the final two parameters in each scheme, inappropriate values can make SCF convergence difficult.


\item[\Key{DFTD2}]
  switches on Grimme's DFT-D2 empirical dispersion correction~\cite{dft:dftd2}.
  The code will attempt to assign the correct functional dependent 
  parameters based on the chosen DFT functional. Analytic gradient contributions are available.
 
\item[\Key{D2PAR}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) D2\_s6\_inp, D2\_alp\_inp, D2\_rs6\_inp} \\
  using this keyword user input values of the $s_6$, $\alpha$ and $s_{r,6}$ DFT-D2 parameters may be specified. If supplied these values override
  any values defined within the code.

\item[\Key{DFTD3}]
  switches on Grimme's DFT-D3 empirical dispersion correction~\cite{dft:dftd3}. The code will attempt to assign the correct functional dependent 
  parameters based on the chosen DFT functional. Analytic gradient contributions are available.
  
\item[\Key{DFD3BJ}]
  switches on Grimme's DFT-D3 empirical dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson damping~\cite{dft:dftd3bj}. 
  The code will attempt to assign the correct functional dependent parameters based on the chosen DFT functional. 
  Analytic gradient contributions are available. This is the presently recommended version.
  
\item[\Key{3BODY}]
  keyword for adding 3-body terms to the DFT-D3 dispersion energy. Note that gradients are not implemented for these corrections 

\item[\Key{D3PAR}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) D3\_s6\_inp, D3\_alp\_inp, D3\_rs6\_inp, D3\_rs18\_inp, D3\_s18\_inp} \\
  keyword for specifying the $s_6$, $\alpha$, $s_{r,6}$, $s_{r,8}$ and $s_8$ parameters of the DFT-D3 methods. Note, take care to 
  match the parameter values to the correct version of the DFT-D3 correction.

\item[\Key{DFTELS}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) DFTELS} \\
  safety threshold -- stop if the charge integration gives too large
  error.

\item[\Key{DFTTHR}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) DFTHRO, DFTHRI} \\
  Thresholds determining accuracy of the numerical integration. The
  first number determines the density threshold (contributions to a
  property from places where the density is below the threshold will
  be skipped) and the second one -- orbital threshold (orbitals are
  assumed to be exactly 0 if they are below the threshold). The
  default value for DFTHR0 is $1.0D-9$ and for DFTRHI is $1.0D-13$.

\item[\Key{DFTVXC}]
  keyword to specify explicit construction of the exchange--correlation 
  potential for GGA forms. This is automatically invoked when .DFTAC is selected 
  and not recommended for use otherwise.

\item[\Key{RADINT}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) RADINT} \\
  Determines the quality of the radial part of the grid and
  corresponds to the upper limit of the error in case of an
  integration on an atom. Default value is $1.0D-13$.

\item[\Key{ANGINT}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) ANGINT} \\
  Determines the quality of the angular Lebedev grid -- the angular
  integration of spherical harmonics will be exact up to the specified
  order. Default value is 35.
\item[\Key{GRID TYPE}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) LINE} \\
  Allows specification of different partitioning methods and radial
  schemes. \verb|BECKE| is Becke partitioning scheme with correction
  for atomic sizes using Bragg sizes, \verb|BECKEORIG| is the same
  Becke partitioning scheme but without correction. \verb|SSF| is a
  partitioning scheme for large molecules designed to reduce the grid
  generation time. \verb|LMG| select LMG radial scheme adjusted to
  currently used basis set. Gauss-Chebychev radial scheme of second
  order is provided for reference and can be selected by keyword
  \verb|GC2|.

% The default is \verb|BECKE LMG| which is optimal for an
%  overwhelming number of cases.
\item[\Key{COARSE}]
  Shortcut keyword for radial integration accuracy $10^{-11}$ and
  angular expansion order equal to $35$.
\item[\Key{NORMAL}]
  Shortcut keyword for radial integration accuracy $10^{-13}$ and
  angular expansion order equal to $35$.
\item[\Key{FINE}]
  Shortcut keyword for radial integration accuracy $10^{-13}$ and
  angular expansion order equal to $42$.
\item[\Key{ULTRAF}]
  Shortcut keyword for radial integration accuracy $10^{-15}$ and
  angular expansion order equal to $65$.

\subsection{\label{ref-dft}DFT functionals}

In general, functionals in \dalton\ can be divided into two groups: 
generic exchange and correlation functionals 
and combined functionals. Combined functionals are a linear combination of
generic ones. There are a large number of combined functionals defined below, 
however the user can also create their own combined functionals with 
the \verb|Combine| keyword. 
A number of standalone functionals are also included within \dalton. 
In addition a number of double-hybrid functionals (energies only) are available,
which include a post-SCF second-order perturbation theory contribution. 

It should be noted that the input is not case sensitive, although the notation
employed in this manual makes use of case to emphasize exchange or correlation 
functional properties and reflect the original literature sources.

  Enter field strength (in atomic units) and property label on separate lines
  where label is a \molecule-style property label on file \verb|AOPROPER|

  specified field-dependent terms, in AO basis.
\end{description}

\noindent{\bf Comments:}

Up to \mxfelt simultaneous fields may be specified by repeating the

\pagebreak[3]
\subsection{\label{ref-mp2inp}\Sec{MP2 INPUT}}

{\bf Purpose:}

\index{MP2}\index{M{\o}ller-Plesset!second-order}
To direct MP2 calculation. Note that MP2 energies as well as
properties also are available through the coupled cluster module, see
Chapter~\ref{ch:CC}.
For open--shell SCF, the singly occupied orbitals are frozen in the MP2 section.

\begin{description}

\item[\Key{MP2 FROZEN}]
  Default = no frozen orbitals\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) (NFRMP2(I),I=1,NSYM)} \\
  Occupied SCF orbitals frozen in MP2 calculation.

  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) IPRMP2} \\
  Print level for MP2 calculation.

\item[\Key{SAVE WF1}] \ \\
  Save first order wave function on SIRIFC.
  Default is only to save first order wave function if MP2 is the last wave function level
  \emph{and} at least one of the modules PROPERTIES (ABACUS) or RESPONSE have been
  requested (presumably then for a SOPPA calculation).

\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Modifications of MP2 model.}

\begin{description}

\item[\Key{SCSMP2}]
  Grimme's spin-component scaled MP2 ($p_S = 1.2$, $p_T = 1/3$)

\item[\Key{SOSMP2}]
  Head-Gordon's scaled opposite spin MP2 ($p_S = 1.3$, $p_T = 0$)

\item[\Key{MP2 SCALED}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) p\_S, p\_T} \\
  Your own scaling factors for a scaled MP2 model.

\item[\Key{LEVELSHIFT}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) MP2\_LSHIFT} \\
  Level shift of MP2 denominators.
\end{description}

\noindent{\bf Comments:}

The MP2 module expects canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals. The MP2 module will
check the orbitals and it exits if the Fock matrix has off-diagonal non-negligible
elements.
If starting from saved canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals from a previous calculations,
although no Hartree--Fock calculation will be done
the number of occupied Hartree--Fock orbitals in each symmetry must anyway be
specified with the \quotekw{.DOUBLY OCCUPIED} under \quotekw{*SCF INPUT}.

The MP2 calculation will produce the MP2 energy and the natural orbitals
for the density matrix through second order.  The primary purpose of
this option is to generate good starting orbitals for CI or MCSCF wave
functions, but it
may of course also be used to obtain the MP2 energy, perhaps with frozen
core orbitals. {\em For valence MCSCF calculations it is recommended that the
\quotekw{\Key{MP2 FROZEN}} option is used in order to obtain the appropriate
correlating orbitals\index{correlating orbitals}\index{MCSCF} as start
for an MCSCF calculation.\/}  As the commonly
used basis sets do not contain correlating orbitals for the core
orbitals and as the core correlation energy therefore becomes arbitrary,
the \quotekw{\Key{MP2 FROZEN}} option can also be of benefit in MP2 energy
calculations.

\pagebreak[3]
\subsection{\label{ref-nevpt2inp}\Sec{NEVPT2 INPUT}}

{\bf Purpose:}

\index{NEVPT2}\index{multireference PT!second-order}
Calculation of the second order correction to the energy for a
CAS--SCF or CAS--CI zero order wavefunction.
The user is referred to Chapter~\ref{ch:nevpt2} on
page~\pageref{ch:nevpt2}  for a brief
introduction to the $n$--electron valence state second order
perturbation theory (NEVPT2).

\begin{description}

\item[\Key{STATE}]
 No default provided\\
\kw{READ (LUINP,*) ISTNEVCI} \\
Root number in a CASCI calculation. This keyword is unnecessary
(ignored) in the CASSCF case.
\end{description}


\noindent{\bf Comments:}


%The present version of the NEVPT2 module requires the
%\quotekw{\Key{DETERMINANTS}} option  to be set.

The use of canonical orbitals for the core and virtual orbitals is
strongly recommended since this choice guarantees compliance of the
results with a totally invariant form of NEVPT2 (see page~\pageref{ch:nevpt2}).

At present the NEVPT2 module can deal with active spaces of dimension
not higher than 14.

\pagebreak[3]
\subsection{\label{ref-optinp}\Sec{OPTIMIZATION}}

{\bf Purpose:}

To change defaults for optimization of an MCSCF\index{MCSCF} wave function.
Some of the options also affect a QC-HF optimization.

\begin{description}
\item[\Key{ABSORPTION}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,'(A8)') RWORD} \\
  RWORD = ` LEVEL 1', ` LEVEL 2', or ` LEVEL 3'\\
  Orbital absorption\index{orbital absorption} in MCSCF optimization
  at level 1, 2, or 3, as specified
  (normally level 3, see comments below).  This keyword may be repeated to
  specify more than one absorption level, the program will then begin with
  the lowest level requested and, when that level is converged,
  disable the lower level and shift to the next level.
% 940816-hjaaj: The following may not be true for RAS ????
% Absorption at several levels are only useful in
% first macro iteration, therefore the lower levels are disabled after
% convergence.

\item[\Key{ACTROT}]
  include specified active-active rotations
\begin{verbatim}
  READ (LUINP,*) NWOPT
  DO I = 1,NWOPT
    READ (LUINP,*) JWOP(1,I),JWOP(2,I)
  END DO
\end{verbatim}
  JWOP(1:2,I) denotes normal molecular orbital numbers (not the active
  orbital numbers).

\item[\Key{ALWAYS ABSORPTION}]
  Absorption\index{orbital absorption} in all MCSCF macro iterations
  (default is to disable absorption in
  local region or after \quotekw{\Key{MAXABS}} macro iterations, whichever comes first).
  Absorption is always disabled after Newton-Raphson algorithm has been used,
  and thus also when doing \quotekw{\Key{CORERELAX}},
  because absorption may cause variational collapse if the desired state is excited.

\item[\Key{CI PHP MATRIX}]
  Default : MAXPHP = 1 (Davidson's algorithm)\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) MAXPHP} \\
  PHP is a subblock of the CI matrix which is calculated explicitly
  in order to obtain improved CI trial vectors compared to the
  straight Davidson\index{Davidson algorithm} algorithm.  The
  configurations corresponding to
  the lowest diagonal elements are selected, unless
  \quotekw{\Key{PHPRESIDUAL}} is specified.
  \kw{MAXPHP} is the maximum dimension of PHP, the actual dimension
  will be less if \kw{MAXPHP} will split degenerate configurations.

\item[\Key{COREHOLE}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) JCHSYM,JCHORB} \\
  JCHSYM = symmetry of core orbital\\
  JCHORB = the orbital in symmetry JCHSYM with a single core hole\\
  Single core hole\index{core hole} MCSCF calculation. The calculation must be of RAS type
  with only the single core-hole orbital in RAS1, the state specified with
  \quotekw{\Key{STATE}} is optimized with the core-hole orbital
  frozen\index{frozen core hole}.
  The specified core hole orbital must be either inactive or
  the one RAS1 orbital, if it is inactive then it will switch places with
  the RAS1 orbital and it will not be possible to also
  specify \quotekw{\Key{REORDER}}. If explicit reordering is required you must reorder
  the core orbital yourself and let \kw{JCHORB} point to the one RAS1 orbital.
  Orbital absorption is activated at level 2. See comments below for more information.

\item[\Key{CORERELAX}]
  (ignored if \quotekw{\Key{COREHOLE}} isn't also specified)\\
  Optimize state with relaxed core orbital\index{relaxed core hole} (using Newton-Raphson algorithm,
  it is not necessary to explicitly specify \quotekw{\Key{NR ALWAYS}}).
  It is assumed that this calculation follows an optimization
  with frozen core orbital and that the orbital has already been
  moved to the RAS1 space ({\it i.e.\/}, the specific value of
  \quotekw{JCHORB} under \quotekw{\Key{COREHOLE}} is ignored). Any
  orbital absorption   will be ignored.

\item[\Key{DETERMINANTS}]
  Use determinant\index{determinants} basis instead of CSF basis (see comments).

  Default for RAS calculations.\\
  Use the exact orbital Hessian\index{orbital Hessian} diagonal.

  contributions.

\item[\Key{FOCKONLY}]

  in each symmetry (the first NFRO(I) in symmetry I) in MCSCF.\index{frozen orbitals!MCSCF}
  Active orbitals and specific inactive orbitals can be frozen with \quotekw{.FREEZE}
  under \Sec{ORBITAL INPUT}.
  Frozen orbitals in SCF are specified in the \Sec{SCF INPUT} input module.

\item[\Key{MAX CI}] \ \\

  a macro iteration
  (APM : Absorptions Per Macro iteration; default = 5)

\item[\Key{NATONLY}]
  Activate TRACI option (default : program decides).\\
  Modified TRACI option where the inactive and secondary orbitals are not
  touched (these two types of orbitals are already natural orbitals).

\item[\Key{NEO ALWAYS}]
  Always norm-extended optimization (never switch to New\-ton-Raph\-son).
  Note: \quotekw{\Key{NR ALWAYS}} and \quotekw{\Key{CORERELAX}}
  takes precedence over \quotekw{\Key{NEO ALWAYS}}.

\item[\Key{NO ABSORPTION}]
  Never orbital absorption\index{orbital absorption} (default settings removed)

\item[\Key{NO ACTIVE-ACTIVE ROTATIONS}]
  No active-active rotations in RAS optimization.

\item[\Key{NOTRACI}]
  Disable TRACI option (default : program decides).

\item[\Key{NR ALWAYS}]
  Always Newton-Raphson optimization (never NEO optimization).
  Note: \quotekw{\Key{NR ALWAYS}} takes precedence over
  \quotekw{\Key{NEO ALWAYS}}.

\item[\Key{OLSEN}]
  Use Jeppe Olsen's generalization of the Davidson
  algorithm\index{Davidson algorithm}.

\item[\Key{OPTIMAL ORBITAL TRIAL VECTORS}]
  Generate "optimal" orbital trial
  vectors~\cite{hjajpjhajcp87}.\index{optimal orbital trial vector} 

\item[\Key{ORB\_TRIAL VECTORS}]
  Use also orbital trial vectors as start vectors for auxiliary roots
  in each macro iteration (CI trial vectors are always generated).

\item[\Key{PHPRESIDUAL}]
  Select configurations for PHP matrix based on largest residual
  rather than lowest diagonal elements.

\item[\Key{SIMULTANEOUS ROOTS}]
  Default : NROOTS = ISTATE, LROOTS = NROOTS\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) NROOTS, LROOTS} \\
  NROOTS = Number of simultaneous roots in NEO\\
  LROOTS = Number of simultaneous roots in NEO at start

\item[\Key{STATE}]
  Default = 1\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) ISTATE} \\
  Index of MCSCF Hessian\index{MCSCF Hessian} at convergence (1 for
  lowest state, 2 for first
  excited state, etc. within the spatial symmetry\index{symmetry} and
  spin symmetry\index{spin symmetry}
  specified under \Sec{CONFIGURATION INPUT}).

\item[\Key{SYM CHECK}]
  Default: ICHECK = 2 when NROOTS $>$ 1, else ICHECK = -1.\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) ICHECK} \\
  Check symmetry of the LROOTS start CI-vectors and remove those which
  have wrong symmetry ({\it e.g.\/} vectors of delta symmetry in a sigma
  symmetry calculation).
\begin{verbatim}
  ICHECK < 0  : No symmetry check.
  ICHECK = 1  : Remove those vectors which do not have the same
                symmetry as the ISTATE vector, reassign ISTATE.
  ICHECK = 2  : Remove those vectors which do not have the same
                symmetry as the lowest state vector before selecting
                the ISTATE vector.
  other values: check symmetry, do not remove any CI vectors.
\end{verbatim}
  The \quotekw{\Key{SIMULTANEOUS ROOTS}} input will automatically be
  updated if CI vectors are removed.

\item[\Key{THRCGR}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) THRCGR} \\
  Threshold for print of CI gradient. Default is 0.1D0.

\item[\Key{THRESH}]
  Default = 1.0D-05\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) THRMC} \\
  Convergence threshold for energy gradient in MCSCF optimization.
  The convergence of the energy will be approximately the square of this
  number.

\item[\Key{TRACI}]
  Activate TRACI option (default : program decides).\\
  Active orbitals are transformed to natural orbitals and the CI-vectors
  are counter-rotated such that the CI states do not change.  The
  inactive and secondary orbitals are transformed to Fock type orbitals
  (corresponding to canonical orbitals for closed shell Hartree--Fock).
  For RAS wave functions the active orbitals are only transformed
  within their own class (RAS1, RAS2, or RAS3) as the wave function is
  not invariant to orbital rotations between the classes.  For RAS, the
  orbitals are thus not true natural orbitals, the density matrix is
  only block diagonalized.  Use \quotekw{\Key{IPRCNO}} (see
  p.~\pageref{ref-priinp})   to control output from this
  transformation.

\end{description}


\noindent{\bf Comments:}

COREHOLE: Single core-hole\index{core hole} calculations are
performed as RAS calculations where the opened core orbital is in
the RAS1 space.  The RAS1 space must therefore contain one and
only one orbital when the COREHOLE option is used, and the
occupation must be restricted to be exactly one electron. The
orbital identified as the core orbital must be either inactive or
the one RAS1 orbital, if it is inactive it will switch places with
the one RAS1 orbital. The core orbital (now in RAS1) will be
frozen in the following optimization. After this calculation has
converged, the CORERELAX option may be added and the core orbital
will be relaxed\index{relaxed core hole}.  When CORERELAX is
specified it is assumed that the calculation was preceded by a
frozen core\index{frozen core hole} calculation, and that the
orbital has already been moved to the RAS1 space. Default
corresponds to the main peak, shake-up energies may be obtained by
specifying \quotekw{\Key{STATE}} larger than one. Absorption is
very beneficial in core hole calculations because of the large
orbital relaxation following the opening of the core hole.

ABSORPTION: Absorption\index{orbital absorption} level 1 includes occupied - occupied rotations
only (including active-active rotations); level 2 adds inactive -
secondary rotations and only active - secondary rotations are excluded
at this level; and finally level 3 includes all non-redundant rotation
for the frozen CI vector.  Levels 1 and 2 require the same integral
transformation (because the inactive - secondary rotations are
performed using the P-supermatrix integrals) and level 1 is therefore
usually not used. Level 3 is the normal and full level, but it can be
advantageous to activate level 2 together with level 3 if big
inactive-active or occupied-occupied rotations are expected.

ORB\_TRIAL: Orbital trial\index{orbital trial vector}\ vectors as
start vectors can be used for
excited states and other calculations with more than one simultaneous
roots.  The orbital start trial vectors are based on the eigenvectors of
the NEO matrix in the previous macro iterations.  However, they are
probably not cost-effective for multiconfiguration calculations where
optimal orbital trial\index{optimal orbital trial vector} vectors are
used and they are therefore not used
by default.

SYM CHECK: The symmetry check is performed on the matrix element
$\langle VEC1 \mid oper \mid VEC2\rangle$, where "oper" is
the CI-diagonal.
It is recommended and the default to use \quotekw{\Key{SYM CHECK}}
for excited states, including
CI vectors of undesired symmetries is a waste of CPU time.

DETERMINANTS: The kernels of the CI sigma routines and density matrix
routines are always performed in determinant\index{determinants}
basis.  However, this
keyword specifies that the external representation is Slater
determinants as well.  The default is that the external representation
is in CSF\index{CSF}\index{configuration state function} basis as
described in chapter 8 of MOTECC-90.  The external
CSF\index{CSF}\index{configuration state function} basis is
generally to be preferred to be sure that the converged
state(s) have pure and correct spin symmetry\index{spin symmetry}, and
to save disk space.
It is recommended to specify \quotekw{\Key{PLUS COMBINATIONS}} under
\quotekw{\Sec{CI VECTOR}} for
calculations on singlet states\index{singlet state} with
determinants\index{determinants},
in particular for
excited singlet\index{excited state} states which often have lower lying triplet states.

\end{description}


\noindent{\bf Comments:}

If \quotekw{\Key{SUPSYM}} is specified, then
{\sir} automatically identifies "super symmetry"\index{super symmetry!orbitals},
{\it i.e.\/} it assigns orbitals to the irreps of the true point
group of the molecule\index{symmetry!group} which is a
"super group" of the Abelian group used in the calculation.
Degenerate orbitals will be averaged and the "super symmetry"
will be enforced in the orbitals.
Note that "super symmetry" can only be used
in the RHF, MP2, MCSCF, and RESPONS modules, and should
not be invoked if other modules are used,
for example, if \Sec{*PROPERTIES} (\aba) is invoked.
%hj aug 04: it should be OK for closed shell cases, also for CC ???
% it is only for spatially degenerate states that elements
% of the orbital gradient may be non-zero, right ???
Also, it cannot be used
in finite field calculations where the field lowers the symmetry.
The initial orbitals must be symmetry orbitals, and the super symmetry
analysis is performed on the kinetic energy matrix in this basis.
The \quotekw{.THRSSY} option is used to define when the kinetic
energy matrix element between two orbitals is considered to be
zero and when two diagonal matrix elements are degenerate. In the
first case the orbitals can belong to different irreps of the
supergroup and in the second case the two orbitals are considered
to be degenerate. The analysis will fail if there are accidental
degeneracies in diagonal elements.  This can happen if the nuclear
geometry deviates slightly from a higher symmetry point group, for
example because too few digits has been used in the input of the
nuclear geometry. If the program stops because the super symmetry
analysis fails with a degeneracy error, you might consider to use
more digits in the nuclear coordinates, to change \kw{THRSSY}, or
to disable super symmetry by not using \quotekw{.SUPSYM}.  The value of
\kw{THRSSY} should be sufficiently small to avoid accidental
degeneracies and sufficiently large to ignore small errors in
geometry and numerical round-off errors.


\Key{REORDER}\index{orbital reordering} can for instance be used for
linear molecules to interchange
undesired delta orbitals among the active orbitals in symmetry 1 with
sigma orbitals.  Another example is movement of the core orbital to the
RAS1 space for core hole calculation.  In general, use of this option
necessitates a pre-calculation with STOP AFTER MO-ORTHONORMALIZATION and
identification of the various orbitals by inspection of the output.

  Initial value of level-shift parameter in DIIS iterations. 
  The default value is 0.0D0 (no level shift).
  May be tried if convergence problems in DIIS. The value is added
  to the diagonal of the occupied part of the Fock matrix before
  Roothaan diagonalization, reducing the mixing of occupied and

\end{description}


\noindent{\bf Comments:}

By default, the RHF/DFT part of a calculation will consist of :
\begin{enumerate}
\item {MAXFCK Roothaan Fock iterations (early exit if convergence
    or oscillations). However, the default is that no Roothaan Fock
iterations are done unless explicitly requested through the keyword
\quotekw{.FOCK I}.
}
\item {MXDIIS DIIS iterations (exit if convergence, {\it i.e.\/} gradient norm
    less than THRRHF, and if convergence rate too slow or even diverging).
}
\item {Unless NOQCSCF, quadratically convergent Hartree--Fock/DFT until
    gradient norm less than THRRHF.
}
\item{If \quotekw{.FC MVO} has been specified
    then the virtual SCF orbitals will be modified by diagonalizing
    the virtual-virtual block of
    a modified Fock matrix: the Fock matrix
    based on the occupied orbitals specified after the keyword, a
    good choice is the inactive (doubly occupied) orbitals in the
    following CI or MCSCF.
    The occupied SCF orbitals will not be modified.
    If the RHF calculation is followed by a CI or an MCSCF calculation,
    \quotekw{.FC MVO} will usually provide much
    better start orbitals than the canonical orbitals (canonical
    orbitals will usually put diffuse, non-correlating orbitals in the
    active space). \\
    WARNING: if both \quotekw{.MP2} and \quotekw{.FC MVO} are specified,
    then the MP2 orbitals will be destroyed and replaced with \quotekw{.FC MVO}
    orbitals.
}
\end{enumerate}

In general \quotekw{.DOUBLY OCCUPIED} should be specified for CI or MCSCF
\index{HF occupation}\index{Hartree--Fock occupation}\index{CI}\index{MCSCF}
\index{Configuration Interaction}
wave function calculations -- you anyway need to know the distribution
of orbitals over symmetries to specify the \quotekw{*CI INPUT} input.
For RHF\index{RHF}\index{SCF}\index{Hartree--Fock}
or MP2\index{MP2}\index{M{\o}ller-Plesset!second-order}
calculations the orbital occupation will be determined on the
basis of the nuclear charges and molecular charge of the molecule as
specified in the \molinp\ file.

By default, starting orbitals and initial orbital occupation will
be determined automatically on the basis of a H\"{u}ckel\index{H\"{u}ckel}
calculation (for molecules where all nuclear charges are
less than or equal to 36), corresponding to the \quotekw{.AUTOCC} keyword.
\index{starting orbitals!SCF}\index{H\"{u}ckel!starting orbitals}.
If problems is experienced due to the
H\"{u}ckel starting guess, it can be avoided by requiring another set of
starting orbitals ({\it e.g.\/} \verb|H1DIAG|).

%The default convergence threshold is quite sharp (compare with the
%default for MCSCF), this is done in order to have good orbitals
%for MP2 calculations.  For Hartree--Fock
%calculations with many basis functions
%which are not to be followed by MP2 or used for finite difference
%property calculations, some CPU time may be save by lowering the
%threshold to the minimum acceptable accuracy.

It is our experience that
it is usually most efficient not to perform any Roothaan Fock iterations
before DIIS is activated, therefore, MAXFCK = 0 as default.
The algorithm described in
Harrell Sellers, Int. J. Quant. Chem. {\bf 45}, 31-41 (1993) is
also implemented, and may be selected with \quotekw{\Key{C2DIIS}}.


FC MVO: This option can be used without a Hartree--Fock calculation
to obtain compact virtual orbitals, but \quotekw{.DOUBLY OCCUPIED} must be
specified anyway in order to identify the virtual orbitals to be transformed.

COREHOLE: Enable SCF
single core-hole\index{core hole} calculations. To perform
an SCF core hole calculation just add the \quotekw{\Key{COREHOLE}}
keyword to the input for the closed-shell RHF ground state
calculation, specifying from which orbital to remove an electron,
and provide the program with the ground state orbitals using the
appropriate \quotekw{\Key{MOSTART}} option (normally \kw{NEWORB}).
Note that this is different from the MCSCF version of
\quotekw{\Key{COREHOLE}} under \quotekw{\Sec{OPTIMIZATION}}
(p.~\pageref{ref-optinp}); in the MCSCF case the user must
explicitly move the core hole orbital from the inactive class to
RAS1 by modifying the \quotekw{\Sec{CONFIGURATION INPUT}}
(p.~\pageref{ref-wavinp}) specifications between the initial
calculation with filled core orbitals and the core hole
calculation. The core hole\index{core hole} orbital will be
frozen\index{frozen core hole} in the following optimization.
After this calculation has converged, the CORERELAX option may be
added and the core orbital will be relaxed\index{relaxed core hole}.  
When CORERELAX is specified it is assumed that the
calculation was preceded by a frozen core calculation, and that
the orbital has already been moved to the open shell orbital. Only
the main peak can be obtained in SCF calculations, for shake-up
energies MCSCF must be used.

{\bf Purpose:}

Model solvent effects with the self-consistent
reaction\index{reaction field} field model.
Any specification of dielectric constant(s)\index{dielectric constant}
will activate this model.

\begin{description}

  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) EPSOL}\\
  Enter relevant dielectric constant\index{dielectric constant} of solvent.

\item[\Key{INERSINITIAL}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) EPSOL, EPPN}\\
  Enter static and optical dielectric constant\index{dielectric constant} of solvent for calculation
  of the initial state defining inertial polarization\index{inertial
  polarization}. Note that the optical dielectric constant specified here
  only will be used in case there is a calculation of response
  properties, for which this is an alternative input to the use of the
  keyword \Key{INERSFINAL}.

\item[\Key{INERSFINAL}] \ \\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) EPSTAT,EPSOL}\\
  Enter static and optical dielectric\index{dielectric constant} constants of solvent
  for calculation of the final state with inertial polarization
  from a previous calculation with \quotekw{\Key{INERSINITIAL}}\index{final polarization}. 
  This can for example be used to optimize an excited electronic state
  with inertial polarization from a previous ground state calculation.
  This keyword an  also be used to specify the static and optical dielectric constants
  for non-equilibrium solvation linear, quadratic, or cubic response functions,
  see also Sec.~\ref{sec:solvnoneqrsp}, but this is usually easier done with
  \quotekw{.INERSINITIAL} (requires only one \dalton\ calculation instead of two).

\item[\Key{MAX L}]
  Required, no defaults.\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) LSOLMX}\\
  Enter maximum L quantum number in multipole expansion of charge
  distribution in cavity.

\item[\Key{PRINT}] \ \\

\subsection{\label{ref-stpinp}\Sec{STEP CONTROL}}

{\bf Purpose:}

\item[\Key{DAMPING FACTOR}]
  Default = 1.0D0\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) BETA} \\
  Initial value of damping (BETA).\index{damping}

\item[\Key{DECREMENT FACTOR}]
  Default = 0.67D0\\

  be increased if ratio is better than RATGOD.

  Increment factor on trust radius.\index{trust radius}

\item[\Key{MAX DAMPING}]

\item[\Key{MAX STEP LENGTH}]
  Default = 0.7D0\\

\item[\Key{NO EXTRA TERMINATION TESTS}]
  Skip extra termination tests and converge micro iterations to
  threshold.   Normally the micro iterations are terminated if the
  reduced NEO matrix has more negative eigenvalues than corresponding
  to the desired state, because then we are in a "superglobal" region
  and we just want to step as quickly as possible to the region where
  the Hessian (and NEO matrix) has the correct structure.  Further
  convergence is usually wasted.

\item[\Key{REJECT THRESHOLD}]
  Default = 0.25 for ground state, 0.4 for excited states\\

  Threshold ratio for unacceptable second order agreement: the step

  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) THQMIN} \\
  Convergence threshold for auxiliary roots in NEO MCSCF optimization.

\item[\Key{TIGHT STEP CONTROL}]

\item[\Key{TOLERANCE}]
  Default: 1.1\\

  (the default value of 1.1 corresponds to a maximum of 10\% deviation).

            iteration.\index{trust radius}\\
  \kw{READ (LUINP,*) RTRUST} \\
  Initial trust radius.

  efficiently if it can be kept within the possible resident memory
  size: the real memory size.  {\sir} will attempt to only use MWORK
  double precision words in the transformation.
\end{description}


\noindent{\bf Comments:}

There are several types of integral transformations which may be
specified by the two transformation level keywords.
\begin{itemize}
   \item[0:] CI calculations, MCSCF gradient (default if CI, but
             no MCSCF specified).
             One index all orbitals, three indices only active

   \item[1:] Obsolete, do not use.

   \item[2:] Default for MCSCF optimization. All integrals needed for {\sir}
             second-order MCSCF optimization, including the integrals
             needed to explicitly construct the diagonal of the orbital
             Hessian. Two indices occupied orbitals, two indices all
             orbitals, with some reduction for inactive indices.
