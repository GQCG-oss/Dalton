\item[\Key{FIELD}] \verb| |\newline
    \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) EFIELD|\newline
    \verb|READ (LUCMD,'(1X,A8)') LFIELD|

    Add an external finite field (operator label \verb+LFIELD+)
    of strength \verb+EFIELD+ to the Hamiltonian
    (same input format as in Sec.~\ref{ref-haminp}).
    These fields are only included in the CC calculation and 
    not in the calculation of the SCF reference state 
    ({\it i.e.\/} the orbitals). 
    Using this option in the calculation of numerical derivatives 
    thus gives so-called orbital-unrelaxed energy derivatives, 
    which is standard in coupled cluster response function theory.
    Note that this way of adding an external field does not work for 
    models including triples excitations (most notably CCSD(T) and CC3).
    For finite field calculations of orbital-relaxed energy 
    derivatives the field must be included in the SCF calculation.
    For such calculations, use the input section \Sec{HAMILTONIAN} (Sec.~\ref{ref-haminp}),
    and do \emph{not} specify the finite field here.

    \index{external field}
 
\item[\Key{FREEZE}] \verb| |\newline
      \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) NFC, NFV|

     Specify the number of frozen core orbitals and number of frozen virtuals (0 is recommended for the latter).
     The program will automatically freeze the NFC(NFV) orbitals of lowest (highest) orbital energy
     among the canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals.
     For benzene a relevant choice is for example 6 0.

\item[\Key{FROIMP}] \verb| |\newline

      \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) (NVIRFR(I),I=1,MSYM)|

      Specify for each irreducible representation how
      many orbitals should be frozen (deleted) for the coupled
      cluster calculation. In calculations, the first \verb+NRHFFR(I)+
      orbitals will be kept frozen in symmetry class \verb+I+ and
      the last \verb+NVIRFR(I)+ orbitals will be deleted from the 
      orbital list.
 
\item[\Key{FROEXP}]  \verb| |\newline
    \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) (NRHFFR(I),I=1,MSYM)|\newline
    \verb|DO ISYM = 1, MSYM|\newline
    \verb|  IF (NRHFFR(ISYM.NE.0) THEN|\newline
    \verb|    READ (LUCMD,*) (KFRRHF(J,ISYM),J=1,NRHFFR(ISYM))|\newline
    \verb|  END IF|\newline
    \verb|END DO|\newline
    \verb|READ (LUCMD,*) (NVIRFR(I),I=1,MSYM)|\newline
    \verb|DO ISYM = 1, MSYM|\newline
    \verb|  IF (NVIRFR(ISYM.NE.0) THEN|\newline
    \verb|    READ (LUCMD,*) (KFRVIR(J,ISYM),J=1,NVIRFR(ISYM))|\newline
    \verb|  END IF|\newline
    \verb|END DO|

    Specify explicitly for each irreducible representation the
    orbitals that should be frozen (deleted) in the coupled cluster
    calculation.
 
\item[\Key{FRSKIP}] 
   Skip the calculation of the F-matrix transformed right eigenvectors
   in a restarted run. See comment under \verb|.IMSKIP|.
%
\item[\Key{HERDIR}] 
       Run coupled cluster program AO-direct\index{integral direct}
       using {\her}
       (Default is to run the program only AO integral direct
       if the \verb+DIRECT+ keyword was set in the general
       input section of \dalton . If \verb+HERDIR+ is not specified the \eri\
       program is used as integral generator.) 
%
\item[\Key{IMSKIP}] 
   Skip the calculation of some response intermediates in a restarted run.
   This options and the following skip options is primarily for very experienced users 
   and programmers who want to save a little bit of CPU time in restarts on very large 
   calculations. 
   {\em It is assumed that the user knows what he is doing when using these options, and
   the program does not test if the intermediates are there or are correct. 
   The relevant quantities are assumed to be at the correct directory and files.
   These comments also applies for all the other skip options following! }

   multipliers in a restarted run. See comment under \verb|.IMSKIP|.
