   Molecule:         Methane (CH4)
   Wave Function:    Local-MP2-R12 / 6-311G
   Test Purpose:     Check LMP2-R12/B method with auxiliary basis and
                     a Slater-type geminal (STG) with exponent 0.5.
                     The hybrid and CABS approaches are used. 
                     Linear dependencies were introduced into the 
                     orbital and auxiliary basis sets on purpose. 

                     Note that on 19-Aug-2005 this test failed with ERI! 

                     (It only succeeds with the .HERDIR keyword. The bug 
                     needs be located and fixed. It may be related to
                     linear dependencies within a general contraction.)
