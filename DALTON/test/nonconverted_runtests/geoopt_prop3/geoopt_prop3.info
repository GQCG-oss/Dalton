   Molecule:         O3
   Wave Function:    MCSCF (CAS) / aug-cc-pVDZ
   Test Purpose:     Geometry optimization using .OPTIMIZE module
                     (2nd order) with a calculation of quadrupole moment,
                     magnetizability and nuclear shieldings at the
                     optimized geometry, along with a vibrational analysis
