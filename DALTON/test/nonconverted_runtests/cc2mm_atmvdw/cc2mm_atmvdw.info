   Molecule:            Phenol (QM) and 10 water molecules (MM)
   Wave Function:       CC2 / STO-3G
   Molecular Mechanics: SPCE01 model: Point charges and isotropic
                        polarizability introduced in the optimization of 
                        the CC wave function. OLDTG=.TRUE. meaning that
                        point charge relaxed HF orbitals are used.
   Test Purpose:        Run checks energy, dipole moment, quadrupole 
                        moment and ground state excitation energies. Test 
                        the use of atomic van der Wall parameters.
