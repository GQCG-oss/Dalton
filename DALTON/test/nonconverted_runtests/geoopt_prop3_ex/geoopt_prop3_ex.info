   Molecule:         O3
   Wave Function:    MCSCF (CAS) / aug-cc-pVDZ / excited state
   Test Purpose:     Geometry optimization using .OPTIMIZE module
                     (2nd order) of the first excited state,
                     with a calculation of quadrupole moment,
                     magnetizabilit,y and nuclear shieldings at the
                     optimized geometry, along with a vibrational analysis.

                     Also test the use of "new" integral transformation
                     for geometry optimization and properties.
