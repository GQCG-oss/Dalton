   Molecule:         H2O
   Wave Function:    CCSD / cc-pVDZ
   Test Purpose:     Check energy, dipole moment and quadrupole moment
                     calculated using the SPC model for the five
                     water molecules surrounding the QM water molecule.
                     OLDTG = .TRUE. (The point charges are included in
                     the Tg operator instead of being included directly
                     in the one-electron part of the Hamiltonian. This
                     gives vacuum HF orbitals and all perturbations are
                     included in the CC part with the effective Tg 
                     operator)
