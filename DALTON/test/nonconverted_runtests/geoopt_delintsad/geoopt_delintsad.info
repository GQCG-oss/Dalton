   Molecule:         C2H6
   Wave Function:    SCF / STO-3G
   Test Purpose:     Saddle point optimization in delocalized internal
                     coordinates. The initial Hessian is calculated, then
                     updated using the Rank one (MS) formula. The step is
                     controlled with the partitioned rational function
                     method and Baker's convergence criteria are used
