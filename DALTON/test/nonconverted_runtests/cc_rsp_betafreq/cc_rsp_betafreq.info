   cc_rsp_betafreq
   ---------------
   Molecule:         HF in C2
   Wave Function:    CCS, CCSD / 6-31G**
   Test Purpose:     First hyperpolarizabilities
                     - Parallel (beta_||) and orthogonal averages (beta_|_)
                     - Static and for two non-zero frequencies
                     - Use explicitly that X and Y directions degnerated
