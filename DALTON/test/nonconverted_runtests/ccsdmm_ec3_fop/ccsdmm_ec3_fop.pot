.MODEL
 SPC_EC3  # This model enters the optimization of the wave function only
.ALPISO   # through the point charges. The polarization energy Epol is
 1        # calculated from the point charge relaxed wave function in a
 9.718    # perturbative way. All molecular properties are identical to
*******   # the SPC model!!! The model is different from the SPC_EC1 model
**TWOIA   # but gives similar results. Both the SPC_EC1 and SPC_EC3 models
.LJ_A     # gives almost identical results to the full SPC_E01 model
 2        # (considering the energy) in a study of liquid water 
 2083000  # (J. Phys. Chem.; 107, 2578, 2003). The SPC_EC3 model includes
 2083000  # the polarization in the most consistent way making it the
.LJ_B     # model which should be preferred in energy studies where the
 2        # polarization is not included in the optimization of the
 45.21    # wave function! Note, that SPC optimization of the wave function
 45.21    # is much faster than including polarization!!!
