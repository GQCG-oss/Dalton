   geoopt_constrain1b
   ------------------
   Molecule:         C2H6
   Wave Function:    SCF / STO-3G
   Test Purpose:     Shows a constrained optimization of ethane, keeping the
                     C-C bond distance fixed (coordinate #1 as determined
                     from geoopt_constrain1a)
