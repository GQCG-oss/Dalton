   Molecule:         H2O
   Wave Function:    MCSCF / aug-cc-pVDZ
   Test Purpose:     Geometry optimization of the first-excited state
                     of A1 symmetry in the molecule using the .OPTIMIZE
                     module (2nd order). Note that this test will crash,
                     due to the need for breaking the symmetry, which we
                     do not allow for an MCSCF wave function
