   Molecule:         H2O
   Wave Function:    CCSD / 3-21G
   Test Purpose:     Check energy, dipole moment quadrupole moment,
                     first ground state excitation energy, transition
                     moment and static polarizability calculated
                     using the SPC/SPC_EC1/SPC_EC3/SPC_E01 models for
                     the 12 water molecules surrounding the QM
                     water molecule. OLDTG = .TRUE.
