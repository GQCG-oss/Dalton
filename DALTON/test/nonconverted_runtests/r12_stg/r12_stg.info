   r12_stg
   --------------
   Molecule:         Methane (CH4)
   Wave Function:    MP2-R12 / 6-311G
   Test Purpose:     Check MP2-R12/B method with auxiliary basis and
                     a Slater-type geminal (STG) with exponent 0.5.
                     The hybrid and CABS approaches are used. 

                     The orbital-invariant energies must be equal
                     to those of test case r12_loc.
