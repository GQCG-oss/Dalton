   Molecule:            Water (QM) and 10 water molecules (MM)
   Wave Function:       CCSD / 3-21G
   Molecular Mechanics: SPCE01 model: Point charges and isotropic
                        polarizability introduced in the optimization of 
                        the CC wave function. OLDTG=.TRUE. meaning that
                        point charge relaxed HF orbitals are used.
   Test Purpose:        Run checks energy, dipole moment and the SHG
                        first hyper polarizability.
                        Test the use of twobody van der Wall
                        parameters and calculation of beta
