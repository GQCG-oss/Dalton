   Molecule:         Formaldehyde and two classical water molecules
   Wave Function:    PE-HF / STO-3G
   Test Purpose:     Test the calculation of cube files containing the
                     electrostatic potential and electric field from
                     the embedding potential using the PE library
                     NOTE: if using the TEST script then the option
                     -param "-get *.cube" is required
