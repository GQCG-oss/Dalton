   energy_fcktra
   --------------
   Molecule:         H2O
   Wave Functions:   RHF, SOS-MP2, and MCSCF (CAS) / cc-pVDZ
   Test Purpose:     Check energy calculation with symmetry and FCKTRA type 2 direct integral transformation
                     (same as energy_symm test, except that .FCKTRA is used)
