   Molecule:         H2O
   Wave Function:    MCSCF (CAS)
   Test Purpose:     Spin-spin coupling constants calculating only the
                     normally most dominating contributions to the
                     isotropic and anisotropic coupling constants, namely
                     the FC-FC and FC-SD terms, thus only solving one
                     response equation
