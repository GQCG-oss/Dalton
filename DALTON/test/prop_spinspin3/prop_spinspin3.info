   Molecule:         H2O
   Wave Function:    MCSCF (CAS)
   Test Purpose:     Nuclear shieldings and Fermi-contact contribution to
                     spin-spin coupling constants, thus note that only
                     three imaginary singlet response vectors should be
                     solved
