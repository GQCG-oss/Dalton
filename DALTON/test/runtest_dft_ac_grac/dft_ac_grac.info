   DFT-AC  
   ------------
   Molecule:         N2 
   Wave Function:    DFT / HCTH(ac) / aug-cc-pVDZ
   Test Purpose:     Calculate excitation energies of N2 with an 
                     asymptotically corrected (ac) functional. The 
                     gradient-regulated ac is used. 
                     Experimental IPs are used as input.
