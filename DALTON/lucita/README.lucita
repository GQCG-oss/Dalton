Hans Joergen Aa. Jensen -- 14. Nov 2009

This directory is for the LUCITA module.

LUCITA has been developed in DIRAC by
  Timo Fleig and Jeppe Olsen
and has been parallelized in DIRAC by
  Stefan Knecht and Hans Joergen Aa. Jensen.

Jeppe and I now want to make this module the
new general CI module in DALTON.

We start on the new "lucita" branch until it works.
