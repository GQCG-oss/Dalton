 Calculation of one- and two-electron Hamiltonian integrals.


 The following one-electron property integrals are calculated:

          - overlap integrals
          - dipole length integrals
          - electronic angular momentum around the origin
          - one-electron contribution to magnetic moment
          - Ket-differentiated overlap matrix with respect to B
          - First order magnetic derivative of electric field
            Electric field applied in X-direction

 In this run  precalculated two-electron integrals are transformed
 to P-supermatrix elements.
