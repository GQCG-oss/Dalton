This is a list of all LSDalton related branches.

We need to have a clear picture at which branches should be:

1. deleted
2. saved in LSDalton repo
3. saved in Dalton Repo.

therefore please update this list when you make a new branch with the intention of modifying LSDalton code.

The Status can be :

Stale          Will be deleted once everybody agrees that the branch is stale
Working        Will be saved in the LSDalton repo
DoNotDelete    Will be saved in the LSDalton repo (maybe as read only)

List of branches that people have taken responsibility for.
